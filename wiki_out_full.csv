2,"This is a very difficult question to answer, because we don't know exactly where the Norse came from. We do know that they came from Scandinavia, and that they settled in England, Scotland, Ireland, and parts of the Netherlands. However, we do not know exactly how they came to England, or how they got there. There are a number of theories about the origin of the Norse, but none of them have been proven to be correct. One theory is that the Norse originated in Scandinavia and spread to England and Scotland. Another is that they spread to Ireland and Scotland, and then to the rest of Europe. This theory is supported by the fact that there is no archaeological evidence of Norse settlement in Ireland or Scotland. The oldest trace of the spreading of the Old Norse culture outside Europe is at Kujataa. The Norse of Iceland and the English certainly shared a common ancestry in 6th century Denmark. The Anglo-Saxons, composed of tribes of the Angles"
3,"I'm not an expert on Norse history, but I can tell you a bit about the Norse religion. The Norse religion was based on a pantheon of gods known as the Aesir. Odin was the leader of the gods. He was the father of all the other gods, Thor, Loki, Freya, Odin, and Odin's son, Odin the Great. He ruled over all the gods of the Norse pantheon, including Odin, Thor and Loki. He also ruled over the people of the world, ruling over the land, the sea, the sky, and the land itself. There was a lot of conflict between the gods and the people, and there was a great deal of violence between the Gods and their people. The gods were very powerful, and they were able to control the land and the sea. They could also control the sky and the sky. They were also very good at war, and could control the weather and the stars. They also had a lot"
4,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""separate identity"". The Normans did not gain their separate identity until after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066."
5,"The name ""Normans"" comes from the name of a group of people who settled in the area in the 1000's and 1100's. They were called the ""Vikings"" or ""Northmen"" because they were originally from Scandinavia. The name was given to them by Charles the Simple, King of France, who gave land near Rouen and the lower Seine to Rollo, leader of a band of Vikings."
6,"France is a country, not a region."
7,"Charles III swore fealty to the King of France, Charles I of England, and the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles II of Spain. He was married to Henrietta Maria of France."
8,"The Frankish identity emerged at the end of the 3rd century, when Charlemagne unified the Western Roman Empire into the Frankish Empire. Before that it was a Germanic state founded by Clovis I."
9,"The Duke of Normandy was the leader of the Anglo-Saxon army in the Battle of Hastings. He was the son of Harold Godwinson, King of England, who was killed by an arrow through his eye during the battle. The battle was a major turning point in England's history. The Normans were able to conquer England, and William was crowned as King William I of England 10 weeks later."
10,"The duchy of Normandy was created in 911 by Charles the Simple King of France for Rollo, leader of a band of Vikings. In 1066 the seventh duke, William II of England, became King William I of England. The title of Duke of Normandy continued to be held by the Kings of England until Henry III gave up the title by treaty in 1259."
11,The Normans were a group of people who lived in the area of modern-day France. They practiced a form of Christianity known as the Anglo-Saxon religion.
12,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The Normans had a huge impact on the development of the English language, culture, and society. For example, the Normans built the Tower of London, Windsor Castle, and many other stone castles in England. They also introduced the Norman language and culture to England, as well as the Anglo-Saxon language, which became the lingua franca of England for a long time after the Norman conquest. The Norman conquest also made England more closely linked with Continental Europe, and made Scandinavian influence less important."
13,"I'm not sure if this qualifies as a ""Christian spirit"", but I think it's worth noting that there are a lot of people who are ""famous"" for their Christian spirit. One of the most famous examples is Thomas Aquinas."
14,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The language of the Etruscans was Latin. The Etruscan language was a dialect of Greek, which was the language spoken by the people of the island of Crete. When the Romans conquered Crete, they brought their language with them. They spoke Vulgar Latin. This became the first version of Romanian. There are many other dialects of Latin, but this is the one I'm most familiar with."
15,"Normandy is a region in the northern part of France. The name Normandy comes from the conquest and subsequent settlement of the area by the ""Northmen"" () also called Vikings. The Northmen were a group of people who settled at Rouen and became the Normans. The Duchy of Normandy began in the year 911, when Charles the Simple, King of France gave land near Rouen to Rollo, leader of a band of Vikings. More land was given in 924 and 933. The duchy continued to be ruled by Rollo until his death in 1066."
16,"William the Conqueror was not a conqueror, he was a ruler of a principality. The Principality of Aquitaine was founded by William I in the 9th century. The principality was ruled by William II, who was the son of William I of England and his first wife, the daughter of William II of Normandy. William's son, William III of England, became King of England in the 10th century, and his son William IV of England was King of France in the 11th."
17,"Norman comes from the Latin word ""Normanus"", which means ""of the Norman people"". It was originally used to refer to a group of people who lived in the area of modern-day France, England, Scotland, and Wales. It might also mean:"
18,"The Latin version of the word ""Norman"" was first recorded in 1082 in a document belonging to the Norman Count Roger from 1082."
19,"Norman comes from the Latin word ""Normanus"", which means ""king"" or ""king"". The word ""Normans"" is derived from the Germanic word *Normans* meaning ""king"", and the word *Norman* means ""King""."

21,"The Duchy of Normandy was founded in 924 by King Charles the Simple, who gave land near Rouen and the lower Seine to Rollo, leader of a band of Vikings. More land was given in 933 and 933."
22,"The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte was signed in the autumn of 911. It was a treaty between Charles the Simple and Rollo, one of the leaders of the Vikings living in Neustria. The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty and military assistance when needed."
23,"The Duchy of Nassau (as a duchy) existed above the Rhine until 1569, when it became a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1791."
24,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. I'm not a historian, so I don't have a lot of sources to go on, but here's what I can tell you. First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Nors were a nomadic people, not a settled people. They were nomadic in the sense that they were hunter-gatherers, not farmers. They had a hard time in the cold winter weather."
25,The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1229 between Raymond VII of Toulouse and Louis IX of France. It ended the Albigensian Crusade. The treaty also said that Raymond's daughter was to marry to Louis' brother.

The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty and military assistance when needed. It also granted him Brittany, ""for his livelihood"". At the time, Brittany was an independent region which France had not been able to control. It would grow to become Normandy under Rollo's descendants."
28,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I think it's important to note that the Norse were not the first people to arrive in Iceland. Iceland was inhabited by a group of people known as the Íslendinga, who had been living in Iceland for a long time before the Norse arrived. The Íslinga were the descendants of the Norsemen who had settled Iceland in the 8th and 9th centuries, and they were the first to establish permanent settlements in the country. In fact, Iceland was one of the first places in the world to be colonized by the Norse, and the first place to be settled by Norsemen. The first Norseman to settle in Iceland was Þorvaldr Ásvaldsson. He was born in the Jæren district of Rogaland, Norway, as the son of Þorbjólfr (Eiríkr Rauði) and Þ"
29,"Rollo was born in Norway in the early 9th century. He was a son of Rognvald, earl of More (present day Norway) and was a Viking raider in France. In 918 King Charles and Rollo met on the border of the Vexin and Roumois. Rollo was given lands around Rouen in 911 by the French king Charles III the Simple. In a charter the king confirmed to Rollo the city of Rouen. By 924 Normandy was growing into a principality. By the time of Rollo's death in 928, the principality had become the House of Normandy."
30,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that there were a number of Viking groups that were conquered by Rollo. The most famous of these were the Ælfreds, who were known as the ""Vikings of the North"". They were a group of Norsemen who lived in the area of modern-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They were known for raiding and pillaging in the region of modern day Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. They also raided and pillaged in England, Scotland, Ireland, and parts of the United Kingdom. In the early 9th century, King Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo, a chieftain of either Norwegian or Danish origin. In return, Rollo swore fealty to Charles, converted to Christianity, and swore to defend the northern region of France against raids by other Viking groups. Rollo was given lands around Rouen in"

33,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""replace with the Norse religion"". The Norse religion was the religion of the people who lived in what is now Northern Europe. It was practiced in Central and Northern Europe before Christianity came there. The religion was polytheistic, there were many gods. The main gods were Odin, Thor, and Njord. Odin was the leader of the Aesir and Thor was the ruler of the Vanir. The Vanir were the gods of war, magic, and prophecy. The Norse gods were not the only gods in the world. There were many other gods, but the main two were Odin and Thor. There was a war between the Norse gods and the Anglo-Saxons. The war ended with the death of the Norse god Odin and his children Freya and Freyr came to live in Asgard. Freyr became the god of war and Odin became the God of magic. Odin and Freya became the two main gods in Norse mythology"
34,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""maternal Old Norse traditions"", but I'll give it a shot. The Norse of Iceland and the English certainly shared a common ancestry in 6th century Denmark. They were both descended from a group of people called the Jutes, who lived in modern-day Germany. The Jutes were the descendants of a group called the Franks, who came to Scandinavia in the late 4th century. The Franks were a Germanic people who spoke a language similar to Old Norse, and they spoke a dialect of Old Norse called Old Frisian. This dialect was very similar to the language spoken in modern day Germany, but it was very different from the Old Norse dialect spoken in Scandinavia. The Frisians spoke a very different language from the Norse, but they spoke the same language as the Franks. They also spoke a different dialect of Proto-Indo-European, which is what we call Proto-Germanic today. They spoke a"

36,"It depends on what you mean by ""major exports"". For example, the Normans imported a lot of grain from Scandinavia, which they exported to England and Scotland. The Normans also traded with the Anglo-Saxons, who traded a lot with the Franks."
37,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll try to answer it. The Normans were Vikings who settled in northern France in the 8th and 9th centuries. They adopted the fuedel doctrines of the Normans."
38,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that the Normans imported a lot of things from England.

They also brought a large amount of cloth, wool, and leather to North Germany, France, and England."
39,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can point you in the right direction. The Order of the Knights Templar was founded in the 11th century as a charitable organization. It was officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129, and became a favored charity by many Christians and grew fast in membership and power. By the 12th century, the Order was one of the most powerful and influential orders in Europe. The Knights Templar, like the Knights Hospitaller, had a large military presence in the Holy Land, and the Order of St. Bartholomew was the largest and most powerful of the orders. The Templars were also the most influential religious order in Europe at the time, as they were the only religious order that was recognized as a monastic order by the papacy. They were also very influential in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire, as well as in the administration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in Southern"

42,"The Normans didn't fight in Italy, they fought in France. The Normans were a Germanic people who settled in France in the 4th century BC. They settled in Normandy in the 3rd century BC, and they settled in Italy in the 2nd century AD."
43,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The Normans were not the first people to come to England. The Anglo-Saxons had been in England for a long time, and the Anglo-Norman people had been there for a very long time. The Norman conquest of England was the culmination of a long series of migrations that had been going on for hundreds of years. The first people who came to England were the Franks, who had been living in France for centuries. There they made a kingdom called Normandy. After the conquest the Normans, although few in number, controlled most of England. They often married English wives and brought their children into England."
44,"I can't speak for the Lombards, but I can tell you about the Venetians. The Venetian Empire was founded in the 11th century, and the first Lombards were born in the 10th century. The Lombards fought in the Lombard Wars of the 12th and 13th centuries, as well as the First Lombard War of the 14th. The first Lombard wars were fought against the Visigoths, who invaded Italy in 1066. The second Lombard war was fought with the Habsburgs, who conquered Italy in 1453."

46,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that Robert Crispin did not go up against the Turks. He was a member of the British Expeditionary Force during the Seven Years' War (1783-1788) and was a major general in the British army during the War of the Austrian Succession (1788-1799). In 1789, he led a group of Russian soldiers to Khadjibey and Yeni Dünya for the Russian Empire. In 1792, he took part in the Siege of Jassy (1789-1792), which was a Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1828-1829)."
47,"Roussel de Bailleul's plans for an independent state were doomed by the French Revolution. The French Revolution was the culmination of a long series of events that had begun in 1789 and ended in 1792. In 1789, King Louis XVI of France declared himself the King of France. This was a huge shock to the French people, who had been used to the idea of the King being the head of the state. However, this was not the end of the Revolution in France. The National Assembly started to carry out some dramatic changes to France. They passed the Declaration of the Rights of Man and ended the laws that allowed the nobles to be treated better than ordinary people. They also passed a new constitution, the Constitution of 1792, which ended the monarchy and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy. This new constitution was very unpopular with the people of France, who wanted to keep the monarchy in place. This led to the Revolution of 1789."
48,"I can't speak for the Normans, but I can speak for Byzantium. The Byzantines had a long tradition of mercenary service, dating back to at least the 8th century. The Byzantine Empire was founded in the 7th century, and was founded by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios was the son of Alexios the Great, and his father, Alexios II Komnenos, was a Byzantine nobleman who had served in the Byzantine army in the 9th and 10th centuries. In the 10th century Alexios became the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, and in the 11th and 12th centuries he became the ruler of the Empire of the Rus. The Rus were a group of Slavic peoples who settled in Kiev and formed the first Russian state. They became the personal bodyguards to the Emperor and were called Varangians. At first they were made up of Vikings or Rus. Later, after the Norman conquest of England, Anglo"

He was also against the concept of a world state as he thought that the world would be ruled by a single country. He also thought that a single nation would be a threat to the stability of the world.

53,"The Franks were not the first people to cross the Euphrates, but they were the first to cross it. The Franks were a Germanic people who had moved their homes over the Rhine into the Roman Empire as it was falling apart. The Roman Empire had been in decline since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 4th century, and the Frankish invasion was the culmination of a long series of conquests that had been going on for centuries."
54,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you a brief overview of the Normans' relationship with the Seljuk Turks in the early 12th century. The first thing to understand about the Seljuks is that they were not a monolithic entity. They were a confederation of various ethnic groups, and they had a long history of conflict with the Byzantines. The most famous example of this conflict was the Battle of Manzikert, which was fought in the 11th century, and was the culmination of a long series of conflicts between the two empires. The Seljuqs had been fighting against the Byzantine Empire for a long time, and it was only in the 10th century that they finally managed to take control of the whole of Anatolia. However, the Ottomans were not the only power in the region at the time. There were also a number of other Muslim states in Anatolia, such as the Kingdom of"
55,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can give you some background on the Armenian Genocide. The Armenian Genocide was a series of massacres carried out by the Ottoman government in response to the Armenian revolt against the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century. In 1894 the villagers refused to pay taxes unless the Ottoman authorities protected them against more Kurdish attacks and extortions. This resulted in demands that Ottoman Turkey initiate reforms in the six ""Armenian vilayets"". The Ottoman government responded by rounding up Armenians and rounding them up. The Armenians were rounded up and sent to the Gulag, where they were tortured and killed. This was followed by the deportation of the Armenians from the city of Yerevan, which was the capital of Armenia at the time. In the aftermath of the deportation, the Armenian population was forcibly relocated to other parts of the country. In 1915, the genocide was carried out again, this time by the Armenian government. This time, the"

At the same time, the Byzantine Empire was in the midst of a civil war with the Ottomans, and the Ottoman Empire was trying to establish itself as the legitimate successor state to the Byzantine empire. The Ottoman Empire had a long history of military service, but it wasn't until the mid-12th century that it really took off. In the early 12th century, there was a series of revolts and rebellions against the Ottoman government. The most famous of these revolts was the Seljuks Revolt, which took place in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. During this time, there were a number of rebellions and revolts against Ottoman rule. One of the most famous revolts took place during the reign of Mehmed the Conqueror. Mehmed"

The House of Hohenzollern was one of the most powerful noble families in the Holy Roman Empire. They held the fief of Lavagna under the Emperor Otto I, and were a major player in the wars against the Ottomans. They also held the title of Duke of Burgundy, which was a title given to them by Otto I in return for their loyalty to the Emperor. The family was very influential in Papal politics, and they had a lot of influence over the Papacy."

There were a number of mercenary families in England prior to the Conquest. The most famous of these was the Dukes of Normandy, who were a branch of the Duchy of Normandy. The Duke of Normandy was a member of the House of Habsburg, which was the ruling house of France. The Dukes were also members of the Hapsburg family, which were the ruling family of Burgundy.

63,"The Count of Apulia was a title given to him by the Papacy in the 11th century. The Papacy gave him the title because he was a member of the House of Savoy, which was the ruling family of Italy at the time. He was the son of the Count of Benevento and his wife, who was the daughter of the Duke of Parma. The papacy also granted the title to him as a reward for his service during the Second Punic War. It is not known what his first name was, although writers in the Middle Ages often called him Lucius."

The Arabs had been fighting against the Byzantine Empire for a long time, and they were able to defeat the Byzantine army at the Battle of Manzikert in 717. This was a major victory for the Arabs, as it allowed them to take control of a large portion of the Mediterranean. However, this was not the end of the story. In 718, the Arabs were defeated outside Constantinople, ending the Byzantine threat in the east and leaving the Empire severely weakened. In the west, the Ottomans had taken control of most of Italy and Sicily in the late 7th and early 8th centuries, and had been able to take over much of the Balkans and the Balkans in the 8th and 9th centuries.

The city of Hastings was one of the most important naval bases in the world, and it was the largest naval base in Europe at the time. It was eventually taken by the Norman allies of Guaimar IV."

She was married to King Edward the Confessor, who was the son of King Æthelred I of England and Queen Æthelfred of Mercia. The marriage was dissolved before the end of 672. When Edward died in 674, his son, Ethelric, became King of Northumbria, and his mother became Queen of England. In 675, the King of England died, and Ethelbert was the heir to his father's throne. When he died, his mother, Queen Ethethelred, was left in charge of the kingdom. She and Bishop Wilfrid became bitter enemies, and in 676, the Bishop sent a letter to the King, saying that he was going to marry Ethelreda's daughter, and that she would be his heir. The King of"

During the reign of Edward I, the English controlled the port of Portsmouth, which was a major port for trade between England and the rest of the world. The port was also used as a base of operations for the English army, and was used by Edward to supply his troops as they engaged their northern foes"

90,"Edward returned to England in 1041. He was crowned king at the coronation of his half-brother Harthacnut on 19 August 1041, and was crowned King of England on 2 August 1042. The coronation took place on the same day as the death of Edward's father, William the Conqueror, at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary."
91,"The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of the Anglican Church in England. Edward the Confessor was the first Bishop of Canterbury, but he was not the first person to be made Archbishop. The office of Archbishop was founded in the year 597. In that year, Saint Augustine came to England, to preach Christianity to the local people. The people accepted him and Christianity when their King (Ethelbert of Kent) became a Christian. Augustine became the first bishop in the kingdom of Kent and was later recognised as archbishop when a second diocese was created in Kent in 734. The current Archbishop is Justin Welby (from 2013)."

The day-long battle ended in the death of the English King Harold Godwinson and a decisive victory for the Normans. William, the Duke of Normandy, was crowned as King William I of England 10 weeks later."
98,"I can't speak to the Normans, but I can talk about the Anglo-Saxons, who were the ruling class in England for a long time before the Norman conquest. There were a number of different groups of people living in England at the time of the Norman Conquest. The first group of people to come to England were the Franks, who settled in England in the 9th and 10th centuries. The Franks were a Germanic people who came from Scandinavia. They were the first people to settle in England. The Normans came to England in 1066. After the conquest, although few of them controlled most of England, they did have a significant amount of power. The Norman dukes were:"

The battle took place between the two armies."

103,"I can't speak to the final form of Old English, but I can tell you that Old English was not a single language. It was a collection of dialects, all of which were mutually intelligible with each other. There were four main dialects: West Saxon, Mercian, Northumbrian and Kentish. All of these dialects were spoken by the Anglo-Saxons, who were the dominant people living in England from the mid-5th century AD until the Norman conquest in 1066. These dialects evolved into Middle English from about the 11th century."
104,"The Hundred Years War was fought between France and England during the late Middle Ages. The war started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without an immediate male heir (i.e., a son or younger brother). Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother, Catherine of Aragon, who was married to Charles IV's son, Charles V of France. Charles V was the son of Charles V, and Catherine was the daughter of Philip II of France, who had married Charles V's younger brother, Charles the Bald. When Charles V died, Catherine became the new queen of France and Charles V became king of England."
105,"The Anglo-Norman language is the name given to the special sort of the Norman language spoken by the descendants of the Normans who ruled the Kingdom of England following the conquest by William of Normandy in 1066. The Normans spoke a language called *Oïl*, which was a dialect of Old French, which was the language spoken in France at the time. When William the Conqueror took over England, he brought his nobles, who spoke Norman, with him. The Norman language became the official language of England, and was the lingua franca of the English people for the next 300 years. Over the course of this time, a lot of words were absorbed into the English language. For example, the word for ""dog"" was borrowed from Old English, and the word ""doggy"" became Old English. Other words were borrowed from the French language, such as ""dog"", ""dog,"" and ""dog"". Some words were also borrowed from Germanic languages, such"

One of the most famous examples of this is Cicero, who was a satirist and satirist of the time. Cicero wrote a book called *De Re Militari* in which he satirized the language of the Romans. In the book, Cicero ridicules the use of Latin as a language for medicine and science, and uses it as a way to mock the Romans for their lack of education and lack of scientific knowledge."

111,"I'm not an expert on Irish history, but I can tell you that Irish culture has had a profound effect on the history of the United States. For example, in the early 20th century, the U.S. Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Act, which made it illegal for American citizens to immigrate to Ireland. This was a major blow to the Irish community, as it made it very difficult for them to sue for redress of their grievances against the government."
112,"I don't know of any castles in Ireland that were built by the Irish, but I do know of some castles that were constructed by the Normans. Dublin Castle was built by William the Conqueror during his invasion of Ireland in 1066. The castle was built on a marsh by the village of Llanfaes. The people who lived there were forced to move to a new village in the west of Anglesey to make way for the castle. This village was called Newborough and it still exists today."

In 1066, William the Conqueror invaded England, and in 1067, Edward the Confessor invaded Scotland. Edward invaded England in 1068 and 1071, and then in 1072 and 1073, he invaded Scotland again, and again in 1074 and 1075, and finally in 1081, and so on and so forth, until he finally conquered Scotland in 1101."

First of all, I'm going to assume you're referring to the Neolithic Revolution, which is a period in the history of the British Isles. This is a very broad term, and it covers a wide range of cultures, but it's important to keep in mind that we're talking about a very long period of time."

123,"Sybilla of Normandy was a very important figure in the history of Scotland. She was one of the most important figures in the development of the Scottish language and culture, as well as the language of Scotland itself. Sybilla was a great patron of the arts and literature of Scotland, and she was very influential in shaping the culture of Scotland as a whole. She is often credited with the creation of the Gaelic language, which is the language we know today as Gaelic. The Gaelic word for Scotland is Gaelic, which means ""the people of the sea"". The sea was very important for trade between Scotland and the rest of Europe, as it was the main route of communication between Europe and the Middle East. This meant the Scottish were not affected by the Romans in the same way the English were."

This law was based on kinship, which meant that if you were a member of a certain family, you were responsible for the actions of your family members. If you were not, then you were free to do whatever you wanted with your own property, but if you did something wrong, you could be punished for it. Common law was also based on inheritance, which means that you could inherit a certain amount of land from your parents, but you couldn't inherit anything from anyone else. There were also different kinds of customaries, which were laws that were different from common law. For instance, the law of Æthelberht (Athelbert of Kent) is the oldest example of Common Law, and it was written"
169,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can give you a brief overview of the legal system in England at the time of the Norman Conquest. Before the Norman invasion, most laws in England were local laws and enforced by local courts. The Normans were able to take over these local courts and use them to enforce their own laws. For example, the law of Æthelberht (Alfred of Kent) is the oldest example of Anglo-Saxon law, or of law in any Germanic language. It was written in the 10th century and is the basis for English common law. The law was based on kinship, which was a system of laws based on the kinship of a group of people. The king was responsible for the acts of their members as well as for their protection. However, the king was not the only person who could enforce the law. There were also local magistrates who were responsible for enforcing the laws. These magistrates were"

The most common type of arched was the round arch, which was used in the Anglo-Saxon period. The Romans also used a variety of other types of arch, such as the flat arch, the square arch, and the rectangular arch. These arches were used by the Normans as well."

The Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in England and parts of Wales, from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066. This period saw the development of a number of different styles of architecture. The most famous of these was the Norman style of architecture, which was based on the Romanesque architecture of Italy. This style was very popular in England from the 11th century to the 15th century, and was very similar to the Gothic style that was popular in Europe at the same time. The Norman style was characterized by its pointed arches, vaulted rooves, buttresses, large windows, and spires."

The most famous of these was the Gothic style of architecture, which was based on the Romanesque architectural style. This style was very similar to that of the Roman Empire."
179,"Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that developed in Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Gothic architecture is defined by its pointed arches, vaulted rooves, buttresses, large windows, and spires. These features were already there in Romanesque architecture, and slowly changed to become Gothic. There was not a clean break between the two styles. Renaissance architecture spread across Europe and lasted until the 16th century when Renaissance architecture became popular."
180,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can point you in the right direction. In the early modern period, there was a great deal of interest in Greek and Roman architecture in England. In particular, there were a number of buildings in London that were built in the Hellenistic style. These buildings were often very ornate and ornate, and had a lot of Greek influence on the architecture of the period. The most famous of these buildings was the Basilica of St. John the Baptist, which was built in 1530. The Basilica was built by a Greek architect named Basilius, who was also known as Basil the Great. He was the first person to introduce Greek architecture to England, and he was also one of the first people to introduce Roman architecture to Britain. He also designed the scenery and costumes for many masques ("

Gregory was the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS Church was a group of followers of Jesus who believed that Jesus had two natures (fully divine and fully human). In 451, a Council of Chalcedon excommunicated (cut off) three leaders, because they held to monophysitism and would not accept the view that Jesus was the Son of God. These three leaders were the bishops of Egypt, Syria, and Armenia. They were also the leaders of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which was the largest Christian denomination in the world at the time. In the early 1500s, the Protestant Church split off from the Roman Catholic Church and formed the Protestant Reformation."

187,"The French Wars of Religion is the name for a total of eight wars fought in France, in the 16th century, between Catholics and Protestants. The most famous of these was the Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1524 to 1598, and was fought between the Catholic and Protestant factions. The main reason for the wars was that the Catholic Church had become more and more powerful in France over the course of the 15th and 16th centuries. This was due to a number of factors, but one of the most important was the Protestant Reformation. The Reformation began in the mid-16th century with the Reformation in Germany, and spread to the rest of Europe in the following decades. This meant that France was no longer the only country in Europe that was divided by religion. Many countries in Europe choose Protestantism as the state religion, so France became one of those countries. However, this didn't stop the French from continuing to fight against the Protestants.

For example, in the early 15th century there was a group of composers known now as the Burgundian School (from Burgundy) who were very influential in the development of music in the Middle Ages. Their music sounded a little bit like medieval music, but they were also very innovative in terms of the way they wrote music. This period saw a massive increase in the composition of music, both sacred and secular."

The monastery of St. Patrick's in Dublin was founded in the late 8th century. It was built on a hill overlooking the River Skell, which is a tributary of the Ure. In the early 9th century, the monastery was attacked by the Normans, who sacked the monastery and burned it down. The monks of St Patrick's fled to St. John's Cathedral in Dublin. They were taken under the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York. After a riot in 1132 at the Benedictine, 13 monks were expelled."

In the early Middle Ages, there were a number of monastic orders in Italy. The most famous of these was the Order of St. Benedict, which was founded by Benedict of Nursia in the 6th century. The order was founded as a response to the threat of the Lombard invasion of Italy in the 5th and 6th centuries. Benedict wanted his monastery to be a center of both learning and religion. In order to do this, he established a monastery in the city of Ravenna. The monastery was named after Saint Augustine of Hippo, who was the patron saint of the monastery. In 674 Biscop, King of Northumbria gave him fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. Benedict used the land to build a monastery, which he named St. Peter's at Monkwear"

The monastery was built on the site of the monastery of Saint-Etienne, which had been founded in the 5th century by Saint Bernard. St. Evroul was a monastery of the Cistercian order, which is a branch of the monastic orders of the Catholic Church. The monks lived in a very austere life with long services and daily liturgies."

During the war, Italy was invaded by Nazi Germany, and the Germans occupied the southern Italian cities of Taranto, Genoa, and Treviso. These cities were the heart of the Italian economy, and many of the people who lived in these cities fled to the cities of other Italian cities, such as Milan, Florence, and Naples. Some of these people ended up in the United States, but most of them stayed in Italy."
208,"Computability theory is a branch of Computer Science. It looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms) to that problem are. There are two major branches in it. The first is computability theory, and the second is computational complexity theory."
209,Computational complexity theory is a way of looking at how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. It looks at how many steps or how much memory a computer needs to do in order to solve the problem.
210,"There is no such thing as a ""task that generally lends itself to being solved by a computer"". It depends on what you mean by ""lend itself to be solved""."
211,"Computational complexity is a measure of how many steps it takes for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem where you need to solve it in a certain amount of time, then you can calculate the time it takes to solve the problem using the computational complexity principle."
212,"Computational complexity theory is a branch of computer science that deals with problems by difficulty and class of relationship. For example, if you have a problem that is hard to solve, but easy to solve for a computer, then you can say that the problem is in the complexity class. If you have the same problem, but the computer can't solve it, then it's in the difficulty class."
213,There is no such thing as a task that is in principle not amendable to being solved by a computer.
214,There is no such thing as a problem that cannot be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps.
215,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. For example, if you're trying to find the square root of a number, you can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if you multiply a number by itself, you get the same result as if you multiplied it by itself."
216,"It depends on what you mean by inherent difficulty. If you mean the difficulty of finding a solution to a problem, then there is no such thing as inherent difficulty of the solution."
217,"There are a lot of ways to measure the amount of resources required to solve a computational problem. One of the most common ways is to look at the size of the problem. For example, if you want to calculate the number of steps it takes to solve the problem, you can look at how big the problem is, and then you can use that to estimate how much time it would take to solve it. Another method is to compare the complexity of different methods of solving a problem to one another. This is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do."
218,"Complexity is a measure of how easy it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you want to know how fast a computer can solve a math problem, you can look at the time it takes it to solve the problem."
219,"It depends on what you mean by complexity. For example, if you want to know the complexity of a circuit, you can use Ohm's law, which is a measure of the resistance of electrons in a circuit. If the resistance is high, then the circuit is more complicated, and if it is low, it is less complicated."
220,"Complexity is a measure of how easy it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of a car, you need to know how long it takes for the car to go from point A to point B. If you know how fast the car goes from point B to point A, you can calculate how much time it will take for the computer to do the same thing."
221,"It depends on what you mean by ""simplicity of the solution"". For example, if you're trying to solve the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a map, then the answer is going to be a lot simpler than if you were trying to find the shortest route from point A to point B. This is because of the fact that the path between points A and B is much shorter than the path from point B to point A."
222,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""intuitively assess or quantify the amount of resources required to solve a computational problem"", but I'll try to give you an example. Let's say you have a problem where you want to find the answer to a question, but you don't know what the answer is. For example, you might want to solve the question ""What is the number of letters in the alphabet?"", but you can't figure out the answer because you have no idea what the alphabet is. You might also want to ask ""How many letters do you need to know to solve this problem?"" and you might be able to figure out how many letters it takes to solve that problem. You could also ask ""how many letters does it take to find this answer?"" and the answer would be the same, but it would take you a lot more time to do that than it would to find that answer."
223,"Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes a computer to solve a given problem. For example, if you want to know how long it will take a calculator to calculate the answer to a question, you can look at the number of steps it takes to solve the question. The more steps you take, the more time the calculator will take to compute the answer."
224,"The simplest unit for circuit simplicity is Ohm's constant, which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of a resistor to the capacitance of the inductor. If the resistance is high, then the light bulb will be dimmer. If it is low, then it will be brighter."
225,"It depends on what you mean by perpendicular computing. For example, if you want to compute the length of a vector, you can use the Taylor series, which is defined to be the product of the length and the derivative of the vector. The Taylor series can be written as: x^(2), where x is the length, y is the derivative, and n is the number of vectors."
226,"Computational complexity theory is a branch of computer science that deals with problems that computers can't solve. For example, if you have a problem that a computer cannot solve, you might want to look at how many steps it takes for a computer to solve the problem, and how much memory it takes to do so."
227,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there's a lot of work being done in computational complexity theory, which is a branch of computer science. Basically, you take a problem and try to figure out how many steps it takes to solve it. For example, let's say you have a problem where you want to find the answer to the question ""what is the best way to solve this problem?"". There are a bunch of different ways to do this, and each of them takes a certain amount of time to solve. For instance, if you take the number of steps to solve the problem, and you multiply it by the size of the problem (the number of possible solutions to the problem), you'll find that it takes a lot more time to do it than if you just took the answer and multiplied it by its size. This is called ""computability"", and it's one of the things that makes computer science so interesting. There are two major"
228,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there's a whole field of computer science called computational complexity theory. It looks at all possible algorithms, and tries to say how many steps or how much memory a given algorithm takes for a computer to solve a given problem."
229,"There are a lot of fields of computer science that are concerned with determining the likelihood of whether or not a problem can ultimately be solved using algorithms. There are two major branches in it. The first is computational complexity theory, and the second is algorithmic complexity theory. Computational complexity theory is concerned with the likelihood that a computer can find a solution to a problem as fast as it can check if the solution is correct. For example, if you have a problem that can be solved by a computer, and you want to know if the computer can solve it in a reasonable amount of time, you need to know the probability that the computer will be able to solve the problem in less than a certain number of steps. The second branch of computational complexity is algorithms.

230,"Computational simplicity is a way of looking at how fast a computer can solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem that can be solved in a finite amount of time, and you want to know how much time it takes a computer to solve it, you can look at how many steps it takes to solve the problem, and how much memory it uses to do so. Computational complexity is another way to look at it. It looks at how hard a problem is to solve for a computer, and tries to figure out how fast computers can solve it."
231,"Computational complexity theory looks at how hard a problem is to solve for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms) to that problem are. An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm, but it may need more resources to do the same thing."
232,"It depends on what you mean by ""probability"". If you mean ""how likely is it to be true"", then there are a lot of different ways to do it. For example, if you want to find out how likely it is that a person is to die in a car crash, you can look at the number of people who have died in car crashes in the last 100 years, and then you can use that to figure out how many people died in the past 100 years. If you're talking about ""how much time it takes to solve a problem"", then you have to look at how many steps it takes for a computer to solve the problem. The more steps, the more time the computer has to do the problem, and the more memory it has to keep track of all the steps."
233,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem that you want to solve, and you have an algorithm that can solve it. You can use this algorithm to solve the problem, or you can use it to solve a different problem. The problem is that you can't do both of these things at the same time, so you have to use a different algorithm for each of the two problems. This problem is called the P versus NP problem and it's widely considered to be the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. To solve this problem, you need to find a solution that can be used to solve both of the problems at once. There are a lot of ways to do this, but one of the most common ways is to use an algorithm. An algorithm is a set of rules that describe how you can solve a problem. These rules are called rules. For example, if you want"

235,"The input string of a computational problem is called the output string of the problem. The output string is the result of the computation of the input string. For example, let's say we have a problem where we want to calculate the speed of light in a vacuum. We have a solution to this problem, but we don't know the answer to the question ""how fast does light travel through a vacuum"". So we need an output string that tells us how fast light travels through the vacuum. This is called a parameter. The data that one computer program gives to another are sometimes called parameters."
236,"Computational complexity theory is a field of computer science that deals with the problem of finding a solution to a problem. There are many ways to solve a problem, but one of the most important ways to do it is to find a ""baseline"" problem. A baseline problem is a problem that is easy to solve, but hard to solve. For example, let's say you want to find the answer to the question ""What is the most efficient way to build a house?"". There are a lot of ways to answer this question, but none of them are ""easier"" than the ""easiest"" way to solve the problem. The problem is that there are many different ways of solving this problem, and each of them has its own problems. For instance, if you have a problem of building a house, you can solve it by looking at the number of steps it takes to build the house, and then you can look at the size of the house. If you have"

245,"I don't know the answer to your question, but I can give you an example. Let's say you want to travel between the 15 largest cities in Germany. You need to travel a total of 10,000 kilometers to get there. The problem with this is that for N cities you have (N-1) factorial possibilities. For example, if you travel between N cities, you have N-2, N-3, and N-4 possibilities. This means that for every 10 cities you visit, there are 10^(10) different ways to get from one city to the next. So you can't travel between all 10 cities in the same amount of time. You can only travel between 10 cities at a time. So the problem is that you need to find a way to get between all of the cities without running out of gas. The easiest way to do this is to take the shortest route between all the cities. This is called a ""straight line"""
246,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""the quantitative answer to the traveling salesman problem fails to answer"" but I'll try to give you an example. Let's say you want to know how long it takes to drive from point A to point B. If you have a car, and you drive from A to B, how long will it take you to get there? The answer is that it will take you exactly the same amount of time to get to A as it will to get from B to A. However, if you have two cars, and one of them is going to be going faster than the other, then the car that is going faster will get there first. The answer to this problem is that there is no such thing as a ""better solution"" to the problem. In fact, there are no such things as ""better solutions"" at all. This is what computer scientists call NP-hard problems."

The shortest route between these 15 cities is N-1, which is the shortest distance between any two cities. The problem with this is that for N cities you have (N-1) factorial possibilities. For example, you could have a route N-2, N-3, and N-4, where N is the number of cities you need to visit before you run out of gas. This means that for each city, you have a number of factorials that you can use to calculate the distance between each city.

250,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The traveling salesman problem is an NP-Complete problem. This means that there is no way to solve the problem in a way that is even remotely close to the speed of light. For example, if you want to calculate the time it takes for a laser to travel from A to B, you can't do it in the same way as if you wanted to calculate how long it takes to travel between A and B. Instead, you have to take into account the fact that the laser has to travel through the air in order to reach A, and then calculate how much time it would take for the laser to reach B."
251,"Computational simplicity theory is a way of looking at how computers solve problems. For example, let's say you have a problem that you want to solve. You can solve it by taking a number of steps and solving the problem in a finite amount of time. However, you can't solve the problem by just taking one step. You have to take a lot of steps to solve it. Computational complexity theory looks at how many steps it takes for a computer to solve a problem. It looks at the number of possible solutions to the problem, and how many possible solutions there are. If there are more possible solutions, then the complexity of the problem is reduced."
252,"It depends on what you mean by ""a string over an alphabet"". For example, a string of length 5 over ""{0,1}"" is ""01101"". If you mean a string over {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,"
253,"It depends on what you mean by ""most commonly used in a problem instance"". For example, if you have a problem where you need to find the answer to a question like ""what is the name of the alphabet that is most commonly used to solve a problem?"" then the most common answer would be ""binary alphabet"". This is because it is the easiest way to solve the problem. If you want to know more about binary alphabet, you can read about it here."
254,"The string of a problem instance is the number of possible solutions to the problem. For example, if you have a problem where you can't find a solution to a problem, you can have a string of solutions."
255,"There are a lot of different ways to represent integers. One of the most common ways is to represent them as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence 2 3 is represented as a string of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s, 11s, 12s, 13s, 14s, 15s, 16s, 17s, 18s, 19s, 20s, 21s, 22s, 23s, 24s, 25s, 26s, 27s, 28s, 29s, 30s, 31s, 32s, 33s, 34s, 35s, 36s, 37s, 38s, 39s, 40s, 41s, 42s, 43s, 45s, 46s, 47s, 48s, 49s, 50s, 51s, 52s, 53s, 54s,"
256,"Graphs can be encoded in a number of ways. For example, if you want to encode a graph as a function of time, you can use a graph table."
257,"A string over a Greek number is a way to represent the number of digits in a number. For example, a string over the number 10 is a representation of 10,000,000."
258,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""never used in a problem instance"", but I'll give it a shot. The most commonly used alphabet in computer science is the binary alphabet. This is the alphabet that is used to make a string (or word). This is a finite Sequence of letters from the alphabet. For example, a string of length 5 over ""{0,1}"" is ""01101""."
259,The string of a problem question is the number of possible answers to the question.
260,"Non-binary notation is used to represent non-integer numbers. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 in the non-binary number system is 1 times 4 plus 0."
261,"Graphs can be encoded in a variety of ways. For example, a graph can be represented as a series of vertices. For instance, if you have a graph, you can represent each vertex as a line, and each line as a point. You can also represent each edge as a number, and so on. A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some symbolic label or a numeric attribute."
262,"Computational complexity theory is the study of how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. There are many different kinds of problems that can be solved by a computer. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of a computer, you need to know how many steps it takes to do it, and how much memory it needs to store that information. You can do this by looking at the number of steps that a computer has to take to solve the problem, and then you can use that information to determine how fast the computer can do the problem. For instance, you can look at the size of the problem and see how fast a computer can solve it. Then you can calculate how much time it takes for the computer to do the same thing over and over again, and you can then use this information to figure out how fast it can do it. The problem is that there are a lot of different ways that computers can solve the same problem. Different algorithms that solve"
263,"The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"" depending on the values of x and y."
264,"Let's say you have two numbers x and y, and you want to know whether x evenly divides y. The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"" depending on the input values. If x is prime, then the answer is ""yes"". If it is not, then it is ""no""."
265,"The output of a decision problem is the sum of the input and the output of the output. For example, if you have two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y? The answer is either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the input. If the answer is 'yes', then x evenly divides y, otherwise it is 'no'."
266,"It means that the algorithm has accepted the input string. If the algorithm doesn't accept the input, it doesn't know what to do with it."
267,"Computational complexity theory is the study of how hard a problem is to solve for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms) to that problem are. There are a lot of different kinds of problems that can be solved, and there are many different ways to solve them. For example, if you have a problem where you want to solve it in a certain way, you can solve it using a number of different methods. For instance, you could solve it by solving it in the following way: 1. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. 46."
268,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""either yer or no"", but I'll give it a shot. For example, if you have two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y? The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"" depending on the values of X and y. If the remainder is zero the answer is ""yes"", otherwise it is ""no""."
269,"I'm not a linguist, but I do know a bit about formal languages, so I'll try to answer your question. Yes is an English word that shows acceptance or agreement, or making a positive response or exclamation. It is the opposite of no."
270,"There are three integer responses to a decision problem: 1. If the remainder is zero, then the answer is ""yes"". 2. If it is prime, then it is ""no"". 3. The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"" depending on the input."
271,"The answer is the sum of the input and the output. For example, if you have a string A and a string B, the answer is A = B + A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H."
272,"A graph is a picture designed to express words, particularly the connection between two or more quantities. A decision problem is a problem that can be posed as a yes-no question of the input values. A graph is an example of an input used in a decision problem."
273,The set of all connected graphs related to this decision problem is called a graph.
274,There is no such thing as a formal language. A formal language is just a set of rules that can be used to describe a language.
275,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem where you want to decide whether to buy a car or a house. You have two options: 1) Buy a car, or 2) Build a house, or 3) Choose between the two options. If you choose the first option, you have two choices. You can either choose to buy the car or the house, and if you choose to choose the car, you only have one choice. You could also choose to build a house and two houses, or two houses and three houses, and so on. This is an output of a decision problem."
276,The set of all unconnected graphs related to this decision problem is called a graph.
277,"There is no such thing as a ""correct"" definition of a formal language. A formal language is just a set of rules that can be used to describe a language."
278,There is no such thing as an indefinite definition of a language. A language is just a set of rules that can be applied to it.
279,A function problem is an example of what?
280,"It depends on what you mean by ""expect"". For example, if you have a function that returns every number from 1 to n, then the number of outputs for each input is n^(n) = (n+1)/(n-1), where n is the size of the function."
281,"The Traveling Salesman Problem is an example of what is called a ""hard problem"" in computer science. It is a problem that is very hard to solve mathematically, but it is very easy to solve in practice. The problem is that there are many different ways to solve it. For example, if you want to find the shortest route between two cities, you need to find a solution that takes the shortest amount of time to get from one city to the other. This is a very hard problem, but there are a lot of ways to do it."
282,"The Traveling Salesman Problem describes a salesman who must travel between N cities. Each city is connected to other close by cities, or nodes, by roads or railways. The salesman wants to keep both the travel costs, as well as the distance he travels as low as possible. To do this, he needs to find the shortest route between the cities. This is a function problem."
283,"It depends on what you mean by a simple or complex answer. For example, if you want a simple answer to the question ""What is the solution to the differential equation Euler's equation?"" then the answer is ""Euler's Equations"". If you mean a complex answer, then it depends on the problem you're trying to solve."
284,There is no such thing as a computational solution where a single input is expected for every input.
285,"It depends on what you mean by ""multiple outputs"". For example, if you have two inputs and one output, then the output of the second input will be the same as the first input. If you have three inputs and two outputs, the output will be different than the first."
286,A function is a function that maps an input value to an output value. An example of a function is the solution of the general quadratic equation.
287,"I'm not sure what you mean by irrelevant, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a function f(x) and you want to solve for f(y) = x^2 + y^3 + x^4 +.... The problem is that you have f(1) = f(2) + f(3) - f(4) +...^(5) and f(6) = F(7) + F(8)"
288,"It depends on what you mean by ""simple"" and ""complex"". For example, if you're talking about the solution of the differential equation, then yes, it's a simple solution. If you're thinking of the solution to the equation of the square root of 2, then it's complex."
289,"It's not just a function problem, it's a set of functions. For example, if you have a function f(x) and you want to find the solution to x^(2), you can write it as f(2) = x^2 + 2^2 - 2^(3) + 3^(4) + 4^(5) + 5^(6) +...."
290,The set of integers is the set of all integers that can be expressed as the sum of two integers.
291,"A decision problem is a problem that can't be restated as a question in some formal system with a yes-or-no answer. For example, the question ""given two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y?"". The answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"" depending on the input values."
292,"The expression set is the set of integers where three integers are multiplied. For example, three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together."
293,The problem of multiplying three numbers is the same as the problem of finding the product of two numbers.
294,The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test is a measure of how easy it is for a computer to read and understand a text.
295,"It depends on what you mean by ""running time"". If you mean the amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B, then the answer is that it depends on the speed of the train. If the train is moving at a constant speed, then it will take longer to get to point A than it will to get there."
296,"There are a lot of ways to calculate the time it takes to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem that you want to solve, and you know the solution to that problem, you can take the time to solve that problem and divide it by the number of steps you need to solve the problem."
297,"It depends on what you mean by ""size of the input"". For example, if you mean ""how big is the input"", then the size of the ""input"" is the square root of the diameter."
298,"Complexity theory is the study of the relationship between the size of a problem and the number of possible solutions to that problem. For example, if you have a problem where you can solve it in a few steps, and you want to know how many steps it takes to solve it, you can look at the complexity of the problem and see how many possible solutions you can come up with. You can also look at how many different algorithms you can use to solve the problem, and compare them to each other to see if they are better or worse at solving the problem."
299,"Simplicity is a measure of how easy it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, let's say you have a problem that you want to solve. You can solve it in a few steps, but it will take a lot of time to do so. The easiest way to measure the complexity of a problem is to look at the number of steps it takes to solve the problem. This is called the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test."
300,"There is no such thing as a ""constant"" in special relativity. The speed of light does not depend on the speed of the observer."
301,"There are a number of ways to calculate the time needed to solve a problem. One of the most common ways is to use a lookup table. This means that you have a list of all possible answers to a problem, and then you can look at that list to find the answer to the question you're trying to solve. Another way is to take the list of possible answers and look at the answer you're looking for, and you can use that to calculate how long it takes to solve the problem."
302,I'm not really interested in how algorithms scale with a decrease in the input size. I'm interested in the complexity of the algorithm as a function of the size of the input.
303,Time is not required to solve a problem. You can calculate the solution to a problem in a fraction of a second.
304,There is no such thing as a polynomial time algorithm.
305,The function of n is the function of *n* times the size of the input.
306,The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
307,"It's not written as an expression, it's written as a logarithmic sum of the worst-case and best-case scenarios. For example, let's say you have a problem where you need to find a word in a dictionary. The worst case is that you can't find the word in the dictionary, and the best case is you can find it, but it's going to take a lot of time to do so. So you write the worst case as log(log(1)) where log(1) is the number of times you have to look up the word, and log(2) is how long it will take you to find it."
308,"T(n) is a polynomial in T(n), so it is the term given to the corresponding algorithm."
309,It's not a function of x. It's a unit of time.
310,There is no such thing as a monoinomial time algorithm.
311,The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
312,"It's not written as an expression, it's written as a function. For example, if you want to know how long it takes to get from point A to point B, you can write it as: x = x^2 x^3 x^4 x^5 x^6 x^7 x^8 x^9 x^10 x^11 x^12 x^13 x^14 x^15 x^16 x^17 x^18 x^19 x^20 x^21 x^22 x^23 x^24 x^25 x^26 x^27 x^28 x^29 x^30 x^31 x^32 x^33 x^34 x^35 x^36 x^37 x^38 x^39 x^40 x^41 x^42 x^45 x^46 x^47 x^48 x^49 x^50 x^51 x^52 x^53 x^54 x"
313,The term given to the algorithm assuming that T represents a mononominal in T(n)?
314,A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. A general computer is a mathematical model that theoretically represents a general computing machine.
315,It is generally assumed that a Turing machine can solve anything capable of also being solved using what?
316,"There are a lot of different models that can be used in complexity theory. One of the most common models is the Bayesian model. The Bayes model is a mathematical model that describes the probability of finding a solution to a problem. It is used to describe the probability that a solution will be found. There are many other models, but this is the most commonly used model."
317,"A Turing machine is just a computer that can be programmed to do certain things. For example, if you want to write a program on a piece of paper, you can program it to do something like this: 1. Write a program to the tape. 2. Read the program. 3. Write it. 4. Read it again. 5. Write the program again. 6. Repeat."
318,There is no such thing as a scientific model of a general computing machine. It's just a model that describes how computers work.
319,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an idea of how it works. A magnetic tape is a thin strip of plastic that is coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. When the tape moves past the head of the tape, it changes the polarity of the magnetic material in the tape. This change in polarity causes a magnetic field to be generated. This magnetic field is then used to manipulate the symbols on the tape by changing the magnetic field."
320,"It depends on what you mean by ""practical computing technology"". There are a lot of things that can be done with a computer that are not practical. For example, if you want to run a program on a computer, you need to be able to make sure that the program doesn't interfere with other programs that are running on the computer. For instance, you can't make a program that doesn't interrupt other programs, but you can make one that interrupts other programs. You can also make programs that don't interrupt each other."
321,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""solve a problem by algorithms"", but I can give you an example of a problem that can be solved by algorithms. Let's say you have a problem where you want to measure the temperature of a room. You can solve the problem by looking at the temperature at different points in the room. For example, you could look at temperature at the bottom of the room, at the top of the ceiling, and at the middle of the floor. If you look at the temperatures at each point on the floor, you will find that they are all at the same temperature. This is because temperature is a measure of how much energy is being transferred from one place to another. Now, if you have an algorithm that can solve this problem, then you can use that algorithm to solve the temperature problem. The problem is that there are many different ways to do this, so you have to look at each step in the algorithm to figure out which one is"
322,A Turing machine consists of the following components (simplified):
323,"Deterministic Turing machines don't have a fixed set of factors, they just have a set of inputs and outputs. For example, let's say you want to turn on a light. You have two inputs: A and B. A is the input, and B is the output. If you turn on the light, A will turn on and B will turn off. However, if you turn off the light at the same time, B will switch on and A will switch off. This is a deterministic Turing machine."
324,"Deterministic Turing machines use a function. A Turing machine is deterministic when if you never change what you give it (the input), that what you get out (the output) never changes either; and you can do this as many times as you want. A non deterministic Turing machine uses a relation. This means that from some states there are several other states that are possible."
325,A Turing machine is capable of multiple actions and extends into a variety of computational paths. A Turing machine consists of the following components (simplified):
326,"A random number generator (RNG) is an algorithm that uses random bits to generate a random number. A deterministic algorithm is a computer science term that means that if you never change what you input, that what you get out (the output) never changes either; and you can do this as many times as you want."
327,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""flexible set of rules"", but I'll give it a shot. A lot of things in the world are governed by rules. For example, if you want to do something, you have to follow a set of laws. If you don't follow the laws, you can't do it. But if you follow the rules, then you can do whatever you want."
328,A Turing machine is an idea from computer science that tries to describe how some computers work. A Turing machine with an extra supply of random ribbons is an example of a deterministic Turing machine.
329,"Algorithms do not always help solve problems more efficiently. For example, if you want to solve the problem of finding the answer to a question, you don't need to know the answer, you just need to find the answer in the shortest amount of time possible. But if you're trying to solve a more complicated problem, you need to be able to solve it in a way that is easier for the computer to solve."
330,"It depends on what you mean by ""multiple possible past actions"". For example, if you want to have multiple possible actions from a given state, you have to have a machine that can perform multiple actions at the same time."
331,"Non-determinism is the idea that the universe is not deterministic. In other words, there is no such thing as a perfectly deterministic universe."
332,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. There are two purposes for a Turing machine: deciding formal languages and solving mathematical functions."
333,"There are two factors that directly effect how powerful a Turing machine may or may not be. The first is the number of transistors. The more transistors you have, the more power you can use. The second is the size of the Turing machine. The larger the transistors, the faster the computer can process information."
334,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. There are two types of Turing machines: Turing Machines and Turing Machines. A Turing Machine is a computer that is able to solve a problem in a language that is Turing complete. For example, a Turing machine can solve any problem in C, C++, Java, Python, or any other programming language. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is Solvable in all of those."
335,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. There are two main types of Turing machines: deterministic and non-deterministic. Deterministic Turing machines use a function to determine what state the machine should be in. For example, if the machine is in a deterministic state, it will always be in the same state no matter what state it is in. A non-Deterministic Turing machine uses a relation. This means that from some states there are several other states that are possible. This can be used to determine if a problem is solvable by a computer or not."
336,"There are three factors that directly effect how powerful a Turing machine may or may not be. The first is the size of the Turing machine. The second is the number of transistors in the machine, and the third is the speed of the machine."
337,"There are a lot of things that are not equally powerful in principle. For example, there is no such thing as a perfect vacuum. There are many different types of vacuum, and they all have different properties."
338,"It depends on what you mean by ""more powerful"". If you mean more powerful in terms of time or space, then the answer is no. Time and space are not the same thing. Time is the amount of time it takes for something to happen. Space is the distance between two points."
339,The Turing machine is not a Turing machine. It is a machine that is Turing-complete.
340,"It depends on what you mean by measurement. For example, if you want to know how long it takes to walk from A to B, you can take the distance and divide it by the time it took you to walk there. If you wanted to know the speed of a car, you could take the time the car took to drive there, and divide that by the distance it took to get there. The speed of the car would be the same, but the distance between A and B would be different."
341,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot."
342,Turing machines are deterministic. Random access machines are non-deterministic.
343,There is no such thing as a Turing machine that deviates from a general Turing machine.
344,"It depends on what you mean by ""conversion between machine models"". For example, if you want to convert from a computer model to a real world model, you need to take into account the fact that the machine model is not a perfect representation of the real world. For instance, you might want to take a look at the following equation: x^(2) = y^(3) where y is the speed of light, and x is the distance from the source to the observer. If you take this equation and multiply it by the distance between the source and the observer, you'll find that the distance is the same, but the speed is different."
345,There are two resources that are uncommonly consumed by alternate models and are typically known to vary from model to model.
346,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""all these models not have in common""."
347,"A Turing machine can be characterized by checking multiple possibilities at the same time. For example, a Turing machine could check whether a word is contained in a certain language or not."
348,"It depends on what you're trying to do. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of an algorithm, you might want to look at the time it takes the algorithm to solve a given problem. If you don't want to know how long it will take the computer to solve the problem, you can look at how many steps the algorithm has to take to solve it."
349,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. A non-deterministic Turing machine has the ability to capture what facet of useful analysis?"
350,"The most critical resource in the analysis of computational problems associated with non-deterministic Turing machines is entropy. The entropy of a Turing machine is the number of possible states that the machine can be in at any given time. For example, if the state of the machine is 0, then it can only be in one state at a time. If the state is 1, then the machine cannot be in any other state at any other time. This means that there are only two possible states for the machine to be in: 0 and 1. If you want to know how many possible states the machine could be in, you need to know the entropy of the state."
351,"It depends on what you mean by ""harder to analyze"". For example, if you're talking about ""difficult to analyze in terms of more unusual resources"" then the answer is that it depends on how you define ""unusual""."
352,There is no such thing as a machine that is not allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once.
353,"It has to do with how fast you want the computer to solve the problem. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of light, you want it to take a certain amount of time to do so. The faster the computer can do it, the faster the light will travel, and the faster it will be able to reach the destination. If you wanted to calculate how long it would take for the light to reach your destination, you would want to know how fast the light would travel in a certain direction, and how far away it would have to travel to get to your destination."
354,"It's not that the machine's branching does not capture many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, it's that it doesn't represent all of them."
355,"It depends on what you mean by ""critical resource"". For example, if you're trying to solve a problem with a Turing machine, there are many ways to solve it. For instance, you can look at the state of the Turing machine as a function of the number of states it has, and you can use that to solve the problem. If you're looking at a problem where the state is random, then there's no such thing as a non-deterministic state."
356,The time required to output an answer on a deterministic Turing machine is expressed as what?
357,"Complexity theory is a way of looking at how hard a problem is to solve for a computer, and how good particular solutions (algorithms) to that problem are. For example, if you have a problem where you need to solve it in a certain amount of time, and you have an algorithm that can do it in that time, then you can say that the problem is in the Complexity Class."
358,"There is no such thing as a deterministic Turing machine. A Turing machine is just a machine that has a finite number of inputs and outputs. If you want to solve a problem on a Turing machine, you have to find a way to solve the problem in a finite amount of time. There are many ways to do this, but none are deterministic."
359,"A Turing machine's ability to solve any given set of problems is a measure of how well it can solve those problems. For example, a Turing machine might be able to solve the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a map, but not the shortest route between any two points."
360,It's not used for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space.
361,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. For example, in a Turing machine, there are two possible states: 0 and 1. In a real computer, there is no such thing as 0 or 1."
362,"There is no such thing as a ""deterministic Turing machine"". A Turing machine is just a computer that can solve a series of problems in a finite amount of time."
363,"A Turing machine's ability to solve any given set of problems is determined by the number of states it has. For example, if a Turing machine has a finite number of possible states, then it can only solve the problem with a finite amount of states. However, if it has more states, it can solve it with more states. So, if you want to know how many states the machine can solve a problem with, you have to ask it what the least critical resource is."
364,Decision problem A can be solved in time x(f). Decision problem B can't.
365,A resource is something that can be used for a purpose. Time and space are both examples of what type of resource.
366,A complexity resource can also be described as what other type of resource?
367,"Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes a computer to solve a problem. The most commonly used measures are time complexity, which is how long it takes the computer to calculate a result, and space complexity, or how much space it takes to store a result."
368,"Communication complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes for a message to travel from point A to point B. For example, if you want to know how long it takes to get from A to B, you need to know the time it took to get there. Communication complexity is an example of what type of measure you can use to measure this."
369,Decision tree is an example of what type of measure you're looking for.
370,"There are a lot of things that can't be made for space requirements, but there are a few things that *can* be made."
371,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""the least well known complexity resources"", but I'll give it a shot."
372,"Complexity is a measure of how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of light, you need to know how long it takes for the light to travel from point A to point B, and how much energy it takes to get from point B to point A, and so on. There are a lot of different ways to measure complexity, but the most common one is time complexity. Time complexity is the amount of time it takes the computer to calculate a result, and space complexity is how much space the computer needs to store the result."
373,"Complexity is a measure of how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. There are a lot of different ways to measure complexity. For example, you can look at the number of possible solutions to a problem, and you can also look at how much time it takes to solve the problem."
374,Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes to solve a problem. A problem with constant complexity takes the same number of steps to complete no matter the size of the input or the number of elements it is computed on.
375,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""case complexity"", but I'll give it a shot. Case complexity is a measure of the number of things that can be said to be true about a case. For example, if you have a case A, then you can say that A=1. If you have A=2, then A=3, and so on."
376,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you want to know how likely it is that you're going to die in a car crash. If you know the probability of your death, you can use that to calculate the probability that you'll die in the crash. For example, if you know that your death is going to be fatal, then you can calculate the likelihood that you will die in that crash. This is called the ""probability measure"" (P) and it's a function of the probability density function (P). Now, let's say that you have a bunch of cars that are going to crash into each other. The probability of each car hitting each other is proportional to the number of cars in the collision. So if you have 100 cars that hit each other, then the probability is that the car that hits the first car will hit the second car first, and so on. If"
377,"Critical complexity is a measure of how difficult a program is to understand. For example, if you want to know how hard it is to solve a math problem, you need to know the number of possible solutions to the problem. A critical complexity measure can be used to determine how many possible solutions there are to a problem."
378,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a random number generator, and you want to find the probability of finding a variable that remains the same size. You can do this by looking at the distribution of the probability density function (Pdf) of the variable. The Pdf tells you what the probability is of finding that variable. For example, let's say we have a Pdf of the distribution: Pdf(x) = (x^2 + x^2 )^2 where x is the number of variables."
379,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. There are three ways to represent case complexity. The first way is to look at it as a function of the number of cases. For example, if you have a number x, and you want to know how many cases there are in that number, you can look at x^2 = x^3 + x^4 - x^5 +... where x is the case complexity of x."
380,There are three different ways to measure space complexity. The first is to look at the distance between two points in space. The second is to measure the time it takes for light to travel from one point to another.
381,There is no such thing as a critical complexity measure. It's a measure of how hard it is to solve a problem.
382,"It depends on what you mean by ""complexity"". For example, if you mean ""how likely is it that the defendant will be found guilty in a court of law"", then the answer is that it depends on the circumstances of the case. For instance, if the defendant is found guilty of murder, then there is a 50% chance that he will be acquitted."
383,"There is no such thing as a ""solution"" to a problem like this. There are many ways to solve problems like this, but none of them are ""solved"" in the way you're asking."
384,"In the worst case, it's O(n). In the best case, the list is already sorted before running the algorithm, the algorithm's complexity is O(N) (Big O notation)."
385,"There is no such thing as a ""worst case"" for a problem. For example, suppose you have a problem where you want to find the answer to a question, but you don't know how long it will take you to find that answer. You can solve the problem by looking at the time it takes you to calculate the answer, and then look at the answer you get when you try to solve it again. This is called a ""run-time"", and it's a measure of how fast you can solve a problem in a given amount of time."
386,It doesn't solve the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input.
387,"Quicksort is a deterministic algorithm that is used to sort elements in an array. It does this by finding the smallest element within the list of unsorted data and swapping it with the left-most element, eventually getting a sorted data. As the algorithm will divide the list into two parts, each iteration thus makes the size of the search smaller by half."
388,"It depends on what you mean by ""limited time"". Let's say you have a list of integers, and you want to sort them. In the worst case, the list is already sorted, so you don't need to sort it at all. The best case, however, is that you do have to sort the integers. In this case, you need to do it at least once, and it takes a lot of time."
389,"Big O is an expression that finds worst-case run-time, showing how efficient an algorithm is without having to run the program on a computer. It is not used to denote worst case complexity as expressed by time taken."
390,"In the worst case, the algorithm is O(n log n) time. In the best case, it's O(ln(n)) time. For example, if you have a list of 1s and 0s, and you want to divide the list into 2s and 1s, you can do it in the following way: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 68 69 70 71 72 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 85 86 87 88 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99 100 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 115 116 116 117 118 123 123 124 125 126 128 128 128"
391,The upper and lower bounds of minimum time required by what?
392,"It depends on what you mean by ""computational science"". There are a lot of different fields of computational science, but I'll try to give you a general idea of what you're looking for. Computational mechanics is a branch of computer science that deals with how computers work. For example, if you want to solve a problem, you need to know how to solve it in a way that a computer can do it. You can do this by looking at the number of possible solutions to the problem, or you can look at the complexity of the problem and see how many steps it takes for a computer to solve the problem. There are two major branches of computational mechanics. The first is computability theory, and the second is complexity theory. Computability theory deals with the fact that computers can solve problems in ways that a human can't."
393,The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
394,"T(n) is a measure of the time it takes to solve a problem. For example, let's say you have a problem where you want to calculate the distance between two points on a map. You can solve the problem by taking the distance from the two points and dividing it by the distance to each point. If you take the distance and divide by the time, then you get the distance. The problem is that you have to multiply the distance by the speed of light. This is called time complexity."
395,A continuum is when a change happens over time or an area without being interrupted.
396,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example. Let's say you want to calculate the time it takes to run a program on a computer. You can do this by looking at the processor's clock speed. If you look at the clock speed of the processor, you'll see that it's always running at a constant speed."
397,"It depends on what you mean by ""best case"" and ""worst case"". For example, if you're trying to solve the problem of finding a word in a dictionary, then the best case is that you can find the word in the dictionary in a finite amount of time. The worst case would be that you have to spend a lot of time looking for the word."
398,"There are a lot of things that don't fall under the field of analysis of algorithms. For example, there is no such thing as an algorithm that can be used to solve a differential equation. There are many different ways to solve differential equations, but there are no algorithms that can solve them all."
399,"It depends on what you mean by ""running time at Mons T(nO)."" If you mean ""how long it would take a computer to solve a problem using a particular algorithm"", then yes, you can show that there is a specific algorithm running time at N. However, this is not always the case. For example, if you want to know how fast a computer can solve a particular problem, you don't need to show that it can solve the problem at N, you just need to know that the computer can do it at least as fast as the algorithm."
400,"There are a lot of things that are easy to prove, but there are also a lot that are hard to prove. For example, if you want to prove that a number is a number, you need to find a way to prove it is not a number. The easiest way to do this is to look at the set of all possible numbers, and then find the number that is the least divisible by that number. Then you can prove that that number is the smallest number in that set. The problem is that this is not easy to do, because you have to find all the possible numbers in the set, and you can't just look at one number and say that it is the most divisible. So you need a proof that the number is less divisible than the number in question. This is called a proof of the proof of a theorem. There are other theorems for which a proof is known, but cannot be easily written down. For instance, the four"
401,"It depends on what you mean by upper or lower bounds. For example, if you want to know what the upper bound of a function is, you can use a function called the Taylor series. The Taylor series tells you how many times the function is multiplied by itself. If you wanted to know the lower bound of the function, you could use an expression called the logarithm."
402,"Big O notation is used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, which is done by calculating how much memory is needed, and how much time it takes to complete."
403,T(n) = 7n2 + 15n + 40 in Big O notation.
404,"Big O notation is used to find the upper bound (the highest possible amount) of the function's growth rate, meaning it works out the longest time it will take to turn the input into the output. This means an algorithm can be grouped by how long it can take in a worst-case scenario, where the longest route will take every time."

406,"It's not that you can't hide constant factors or smaller terms, it's that it's very difficult to do so."
407,"It depends on what you mean by ""specific details of the computational model"".

409,"There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a classification system. For example, if you want to classify something, you need to know what it is, what it does, and what it doesn't do. If you don't know, you can't classify it."
410,"A Complexity Class is a class of problems that have the same complexity, but differ in the way they are solved.

411,"Complexity is a concept in computer science. It's a way of looking at how hard it is to solve a problem.

If you know how fast the car is going, then you can calculate how long the car will take to get to the destination. You can also calculate how many times the car has to go back and forth between point A and point B. The problem with complexity is that it's hard to define what a ""complexity class"" is.

453,"There is no such thing as a framework. A framework is a set of rules that describe how an application should behave. For example, if you want to create a web page, you need to have a framework that describes how the web page should look, behave, and interact with other web pages."
454,"Complexity is a concept in computer science and mathematics. It is a way of describing the number of possible solutions to a problem. There are a lot of different types of complexity classes. For example, there are NP-complete (NP-complete) problems, which are problems that can be solved in a finite amount of time. Another type of complexity class is CP-complete, which is a class of problems that have a finite number of solutions. There is a lot more to it than that, but that is the basic idea."
455,"Complexity is a measure of how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. There are a lot of different ways to measure complexity, but the most common one is time complexity. Time complexity is the amount of time it takes for the computer to calculate the answer to a question. For example, if you want to know how long it will take for a person to walk to the grocery store, you can calculate the time it would take for the person to get to the store. Another way to measure the complexity of a problem is the number of steps it takes to solve the problem. A problem with constant complexity is a problem that takes the same amount of steps to solve no matter how many steps it is computed on."
456,"Computation time is a measure of the amount of time it takes to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem where you want to calculate the answer to a question, you can solve it by dividing the number of possible answers by the size of the problem. This is called a ""concrete bounding"" of computation time. However, there are a lot of other things that can affect the computation time of a problem, such as how fast the computer can process the answer, how much memory it can store the answer in, and so on. A complexity class is just a list of problems that are in the same complexity class."
457,A Turing machine is a machine that can solve a problem in a finite amount of time. A multi-tape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution to be found on the tape.
458,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. A language is a set of rules and transitions that a computer can use to solve a problem. For example, a Turing machine can decide whether a given word is contained in a certain language or not."
459,A polynomial relationship exists within time complexities in a computational model.
460,"Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes for a computer to solve a problem. The most commonly used models for complexity are time complexity, memory complexity, and space complexity."
461,"A reduction is a chemical reaction that involves the gaining of electrons by one of the atoms involved in the reaction between two chemicals. In this case, the reduction is the reduction of a substance to a lower energy state."
462,If X and Y can be solved by the same algorithm then X performs what function in relationship to Y?
463,"A reduction is taking a part of a whole thing and making it smaller. For example, if you take a piece of paper and make it smaller, you can make it easier to read."
464,Polynomial time reductions are an example of what?
465,Complexity is defined by the number of steps it takes to solve a problem. A problem with constant complexity is a problem that takes the same amount of steps to solve no matter how many elements it is computed on.
466,"Theorem of Reduction says that the number of electrons in an atom is the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom. So if you have two atoms, one has more protons than the other, and one has less neutrons, then the total amount of electrons is reduced."
467,A transformation of two problems into on three problems is the same as a transformation of one problem into two problems.
468,There is no such thing as a problem that is at lease as difficult as another problem.
469,The six types of reduction are: 1. Take a part of a whole thing and make it smaller. 2. Make a small part of the whole thing smaller. 3. Make the part smaller. 4. Make it larger. 5. Make something smaller. 6. Make things smaller.
470,"It depends on what you mean by reduction. For example, if you mean the reduction of a verb to a noun, you can reduce the verb ""to"" to ""to do"" and the noun ""to go""."
471,"The square root of 2, or the (1/2)th power of 2 is the positive irrational number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the number 2."
472,The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy principle.
473,"It depends on what you mean by ""the same outcome"". For example, if you multiply two integers by 2, you get the same result as if you multiplied them by 2. If you multiply them by 3, the result is the same as multiplying them by 4."
474,"I'm not sure what you mean by polynomial time reduction, but I'll try to give you an example. Let's say you have a number x, and you want to know how long it takes to divide by x. You can do this by dividing by x by 2, and then dividing by 2 by 3, and so on and so forth. The problem is that you can't just divide by 2 and then divide by 3. You have to multiply by 3 to get the same result."
475,"I don't know what you mean by ""the least used type of reduction""."
476,Polynomial-space reduction is the idea that you can reduce polynomial spaces to polynomials.
477,"The problem of dividing an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying an integer by itself. For example, if you have two integers A and B, and you want to multiply them by each other, you can do this by dividing A by B."
478,"There is no such thing as a ""constant"" in addition and multiplication. If you multiply two integers by a constant, you will get the same result if you multiply them by a different constant."
479,Multiplication is not more difficult than addition. It's just easier to do.
480,"The complexity of a problem depends on the size of the problem. For example, if you have a problem of finding the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the answer to that question is 1, then the answer will be 1. But if you want to find the number 2, then you need to know the number 3, and then the number 4, and so on and so forth. The complexity of that problem will depend on how big the problem is, and how many steps you have to take to solve it."
481,There is no conflict between problem X and problem C within the context of reduction.
482,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem that you want to solve in C. You can solve it in C, but you can't do it in any other language, so you need to find a way to convert it to another language. The easiest way to do this is to use a compiler, which is a program that converts the C code into a language that you can understand. For example, let's say I want to do the following in C: x = 5*10 + 6 + 1. The compiler will convert this to C, and then convert it back to C. This is called recursion, and it can be done in any language, but it's usually done in C because that's the easiest language to understand."
483,The problem set that is hard for the expression NP can also be stated how?
484,"Complexity is a measure of how easy it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem of finding the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, a computer may take a very long time for the computer to come up with the answer, but it will take the same amount of time for a human to figure out the answer. A problem with constant complexity takes the same number of steps to complete no matter the size of the input or the number of elements."
485,There is no conflict between problem X and problem C within the context of reduction.
486,"It depends on what you mean by ""harder than X"". There are a lot of problems in C that are harder than X, but there are also many problems that are easier than X."
487,It's not a problem set that is hard for expression QP to be stated. It's a problem that can't be expressed in QP.
488,"The hardest problems in NP can be analogously written as what class of problems are the hardest to solve. For example, if you have a set of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and you want to find the answer to the question ""What is the number 1?"" then you can write down the answer as ""1,2,3,4,5"". However, you can't write it down as ""The number 1 is a prime number"". You can write it as ""A prime number is a number between 1 and 2"". This is called a NP-hard problem."
489,NP-complete problems contain the lowest likelihood of being located in what problem class?
490,There is no such thing as a polynomial time algorithm for a known NP-complete problem.
491,NP-complete is the set of all decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time on a machine.
492,"It depends on what you mean by ""soft"" and ""hard"". For example, if you have a problem in C, and you want to solve it in soft, you can do it in C. However, if the problem is in hard, then you can't do the same thing in soft."
493,"It depends on what you mean by ""softest problem"". If you mean ""hardest problem in C"", then it depends on how you define ""soft"". For example, if you define a ""soft problem"" as a problem that can be solved in C, then there is no such thing as a ""hard problem"" in C."
494,"The class NP-complete (NP-C or NPC) is a class of problems having two properties: 1) The number of steps needed to check the answer is smaller than the size of the problem, and 2) The solution can quickly be checked as being true."
495,There is no known polynomial-time solution for Ii1.
496,"Complexity is a measure of how many steps it takes for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you want to solve the problem of finding the answer to a question, you need to take a number of steps to find the answer. The complexity class NP-complete (abbreviated NP-C or NPC-C) is a class of problems that have the same complexity as NP-A or NP-B. This means that for a given input, they need about the same amount of resources, such as compute time, or memory."
497,"Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem where you need to solve it in a given time, then the complexity of the problem is the number of steps it takes to solve that problem. The more steps you take to solve the problem, the more time it will take for your computer to do the same thing over and over again."
498,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""known algorithms to enhance solvability"". There are many algorithms that can be used to improve the solvency of a problem. For example, if you have a problem where you want to find the answer to a question, you can use an algorithm to solve the problem in a way that makes the problem easier to solve in the future."
499,"There is no such thing as a problem that rests within the NP complexity class. NP-complete (NP-C or NP-C) is a class of problems that we can quickly check solutions for, but that can not be checked quickly (it is NP-hard, but it is not NP)."
500,"It's not confirmed that a problem in P belies membership in the NP class, it's confirmed that there is no algorithm that can solve all NP problems in polynomial time."
501,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""an efficient algorithm"". An efficient algorithm is a way to solve a problem in a way that is computationally efficient. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of a car, you can calculate the time it takes to drive from A to B. You can calculate how many steps it takes for the car to get to A from B, and you can compute how many times the car has to go back to A to get back to B from A. This is called an efficient algorithm."
502,"The Cobham-Edward thesis is the idea that there is no such thing as a ""true"" or ""false"" theory of quantum mechanics. The idea is that quantum mechanics is not a theory, but a set of rules that describe how quantum mechanics works. For example, if you have a quantum theory of gravity, and you want to know how gravity works, you need to know what the laws of gravity are, and how they relate to each other, and so on. If you want a theory that describes quantum mechanics, then you need a theory about quantum field theory. This theory is called the ""Cobham-Eddington thesis""."
503,There is no known algorithm to enhance solubility. Solubility is the ability of a substance (the solute) to mix into a liquid (the solvent).
504,"It's not a problem that rests within the NP simplicity class, it's a problem which is NP-Complete. This means that if someone found a way to solve it quickly, they could use that same method to solve any NP problem quickly."
505,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""theoretical machine did not confirm that a problem in P belies membership in the NP class"". There is no such thing as a proof that a program in NP does not exist. There are many reasons why it has no proof."
506,"If P is ultimately proven to be equal tot NP, what effect would this have on the efficiency of problems? If P = NP, it would mean that no general, fast way to solve those NP problems can exist, no matter how hard we look."
507,"There are a lot of problems in biology that would benefit from determining that P = NP. One of the most important problems is that we don't have a good way to calculate the number of mitochondria in a cell. We don't know how many mitochondria there are, or how many of them are in the mitochondria. We know that mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, and we know that the amount of oxygen in the cell is proportional to the mass of the cell. However, we have no way of knowing how much oxygen there is in a mitochondria, and how much of it is in the cytoplasm. If we can prove that P and NP are the same (P = NP is true), then we can use that knowledge to figure out how to calculate how much energy a cell needs to be in order for it to respire."
508,"P=NP is one of the most important unsolved problems in the field of computer science. There is no known algorithm that can solve it in polynomial time, and there is no reason to believe that there is such an algorithm. It is widely believed that this is not the case. The prize offered is $1,000,000."
509,"There are a lot of open questions in theoretical computer science, but the most important ones are: 1. What is the limit on the number of operations that can be performed on a computer? 2. What are the limits on the amount of information that a computer can store? 3. What can a computer store? 4. How do computers store information? 5. How can computers store data?"
510,"If P is proven to not equal NP, it would mean that no general, fast ways to solve those NP problems can exist, no matter how hard we look."
511,P = NP is not the only problem in chemistry that would benefit from determining that P = NP.
512,"I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The problem you're asking about is called the Poincaré conjecture, and it's one of the seven most important unsolved mathematical questions in computer science. It was proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution."
513,There was no prize for finding a solution to P=NP at the Alpha Prize Problems.
514,"P=NP implies that there are no problems not present in P or NP-complete. This is not the case. There are problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and there are algorithms that can solve them in quadratic or linear time."
515,"A problem that meets Ladner's assertion is a problem where the solution to a problem is not the same as the problem itself. For example, if you want to solve a problem, you need to find a way to solve the problem in such a way that the solution is the same everywhere."
516,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""NP-intermediate"", but I'll try to give you an example of a problem that is not known to exist in P or NP-complete."
517,There are problems in NP that are neither P nor NQ-complete.
518,"A problem that meets Ladder's assertion is a problem where there is no solution to a problem. For example, if you want to solve a problem, you have to find a solution to the problem. If you can't solve the problem, then you have no solution. A problem is just a problem that doesn't have a solution."
519,There is no example of an NP-intermediate problem not known to exist in P or NP-complete.
520,"There are four examples of problems believed to be NP=intermediate. The first is the problem of finding the solution to the differential equation. The problem is NP-hard, but it is easy to solve. The second is a problem that we can quickly check solutions for, but that can not be checked quickly (NP-hard), and the third is an unsolved problem."
521,It's not a problem of defining if two finite graphs are isomorphic. It's the problem of proving that a finite graph is isomorphic to a non-finite graph.
522,"The graph isomorphism problem is one of the most difficult problems in mathematics. There are many ways to solve it, and there are many different ways to prove that it is a problem. One of the ways is to use the Riemann Hypothesis, which states that if you have a graph, you can prove that the graph isomorphic to that graph. However, there is no proof that this is the case. The problem is still unsolved. Another way to solve the problem is to look at the graph itself. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics."
523,The graph isomorphism problem is NP-complete.
524,"It depends on what you mean by ""graph isomorphism is NP-complete"". If you mean a complete graph of order n, then there is no such thing as a polynomial time hierarchy. For example, if you have a graph with n vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge, then polynomials can be written as n^(n), where n is the number of vertices."
525,"I'm not sure if this is the question you're looking for, but you might be interested in this previous answer by /u/commiespaceinvader"
526,"The graph isolation problem is the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. For example, if you want to find the shortest way from a vertex to a vertex, you need to find a path that goes from point A to point B. If you can't find that path, then you have a problem."
527,The problem isn't defining if three finite graphs are isomorphic. The problem is defining if any finite graph is isomorphic to any other finite graph.
528,"Complexity theory is a field of computer science that deals with the problem of finding a solution to a problem. One of the most important problems in complexity theory is finding a way to solve a problem in a way that is computationally efficient. For example, if you have a problem where you need to find the answer to a question, you can solve it by solving the problem in such a way as to minimize the amount of time it takes you to solve the problem. However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and there are many different ways to solve it. In order to solve this problem, you have to find an algorithm that is very efficient in all cases, but is very computationally expensive in the worst case. This is called a ""worst case"" problem, and it is one of the biggest unsolved problems in computer science. There are a lot of different algorithms that can be used to solve these worst-case problems, but none of them are very efficient."
529,"The graph isomorphism problem is not NQ-complete, it is NP-complete."
530,"It depends on what you mean by NQ-complete. If you mean a complete graph of order n, then yes, it would collapse. For example, if you have a graph with n vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge, then the graph is NQ complete."
531,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""commonly associated with prime factorization"", but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a set of numbers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, Z, and Z are all prime numbers. You want to find the smallest prime number between A and B. This can be done by dividing the given number from A to B, then dividing the number from C to D, and so on until all its factors are prime."
532,"Let's say you have an input and an output, and you want to know if the input is less than the output. You can do this by taking the value of the input and multiplying it by the number of factors. For example, you can take the number 1 and multiply it by 2, and divide it by 3, and so on."
533,It's not that there's no known integer factorization problem. It's that we don't know how to solve it.
534,"The most well-known algorithm for the integer factorization problem is Euclidean Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. For example, if you have a number A and a number B, then you can divide A by B, and then divide B by A, and so on."
535,The integer practice problem is the problem of finding an algorithm that can say whether a Diophantine equation has integer solutions.
536,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""not commonly associated with prime factorization""."
537,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""decide whether the input has a factor more than k"". There is no such thing as a ""decision problem"". A decision problem is a question in some formal system with a yes-or-no answer."
538,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem that has a polynomial time solution, and you want to solve it in a finite amount of time. For example, let's say we have a solution to the problem:"
539,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""the least well known algorithm associated with the integer factorization problem"". There are a number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, but none of them are particularly well-known. One of the most famous is Euclidean Algorithm, which uses repeated long division to find the greatest common factor of two numbers."
540,Complexity is just a measure of how many steps it takes to solve a problem. A problem with constant complexity takes the same number of steps to complete no matter the size of the input or the number of elements it is computed on.
541,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem that you want to solve, and you're trying to solve it in a finite amount of time. For example, let's say that you need to solve this problem in 1 second. You can solve this in 1/2 the time it takes you to solve the problem in the first place, but you can't do it in the second place. The problem is in the same complexity class as the first problem, but it's not the same problem. In other words, the problem is the same, but the second problem is more complicated."
542,"Complexity is a concept in computer science. It's a way of describing the number of steps needed to solve a problem. For example, if you have a problem where you need to solve it in a certain amount of time, you can think of it as having a complexity of 1. If you want to know how many steps it takes to solve that problem, then you can look at the complexity of the problem. The most commonly used models for complexity are time complexity, space complexity, and memory complexity. A Complexity class is a group of problems that have the same complexity."
543,"Complexity theory has been around for a long time, but it is still very much in its infancy. There is a lot of work to be done in this field, and it will take a while to get to a point where we can say ""this is what complexity theory is all about""."
544,"Complexity is a measure of how hard it is for a computer to solve a problem. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of a car, you need to know how long it takes to drive from point A to point B, and how much time it will take to get from point B to point A. If you know how fast a car is going to go from A to B, then you can calculate the time it takes for a car to get to A. This is called time complexity. Another way to think about it is that if you have a problem that takes a lot of time to solve, and a computer that can solve it in a very short amount of time, then the computer is in the same complexity class as the problem. This means that for a given input, they need about the same amount of resources to solve the same problem."
545,"I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a problem that you want to solve, and you're trying to solve it in a finite amount of time. There are two ways to solve this problem: 1. You can solve the problem in finite amounts of time, or you can solve it as a finite number of times, or both. The first way is the simplest, and the second is the most difficult. In the first case, the problem is easy to solve. The second way is more difficult, and it takes a lot more time. In both cases, the answer to your question is the same. The answer to the second question is more complicated than the first, but it's still the same answer."
546,"RPP, BPP, PPP, PBP, BQP, MA, and PH are all complexity classes. A complexity class is a group of problems that have the same complexity. For example, if you have a problem that has the same number of inputs, and the same output, you can say that the problem is in the RPP complexity class."
547,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""impossible"", but I'll give it a shot. There is no such thing as a ""hard problem"" in complexity theory. There are a lot of problems that are difficult to solve, but they are not impossible. For example, there are many problems that can be described as ""hard problems"", but there are also many problems which are ""easy problems""."
548,"Complexity theory is not a theory. It is a set of rules that describe how computers solve problems. For example, if you want to solve a problem, you need to find a way to solve it in a way that makes it easy for humans to understand. If you can't do that, then you have to come up with a new way to do it."
549,"It depends on what you mean by complement. For example, if you mean complement problems of NP problems, then there is a class of problems called NP-complete (NP-C or NP-C) that can be solved in polynomial time on a machine. For instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is known to be NP complete."
550,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The complement of each primary color (red, blue, or yellow) is roughly the color made by mixing the other two in a subtractive system (red + blue = purple; blue + yellow = orange). When two complements are mixed they produce a gray or brown. The answer to the complement problem of NP is ""yes"" or ""no""."
551,"P is the probability that the null hypothesis (the idea that a theory being tested is false) gives for a specific experimental result to happen. If P is high, then the experiment is likely to be false, and if P is low, the experiment has statistical significance as evidence for a different theory."
552,"If P and NP are equal to each other, then there is no way to prove that P is equal to NP."
553,NP-complete (NP-C or NP-C) is a class of problems having two properties: 1) The number of steps needed to check the answer is smaller than the polynomial size of the problem. 2) The problem can be solved in a finite amount of time.
554,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Let's say you have a set of numbers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, X, Y, Z, ZY, YZ, ZZ, and ZZ. You have a list of all possible combinations of these numbers. For example, let's say we have A=1, B=2, C=3, Z=4, and YZ=5. The list of possible combinations is: A=2 B=3 C=4 D=5 E=6 Z=7 Z=8 Z=9 Z=10 Z=11 Z=12 Z=13 Z=14 Z=15 Z=16 Z=17 Z=18 Z=19 Z=20 Z=21 Z="
555,P and NP are not the same thing. P is the probability that the null hypothesis (the idea that a theory being tested is false) gives for a specific experimental result to happen. NP is the likelihood that a particular experimental result is true.
556,P and NP are equal to each other. There is no way to prove that P is equal to NP.
557,"There is no such thing as a ""logarithmic solution"" to a problem. It's just a way of saying that you can solve a problem in a certain way."
558,The most commonly ascribed attributes of L in relation to P are the following: 1. L is a positive number. 2. P is a negative number. 3. A is a multiple of p.
559,"L and P are not the same thing. L is the number of protons in a system, and P is the amount of neutrons in the system. The relationship between L and P has nothing to do with how many protons there are."
560,Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes to solve a problem. There are two types of complexity: time complexity and space complexity. The time complexity of a problem is the number of calculations that need to be done in order to solve the problem. The space complexity of the problem is how much space is required to store the result of the calculation.
561,L and P are not the same thing. L is the number of possible solutions to a problem. P is the amount of time it takes to solve the problem.
562,"There is no such thing as a ""logarithmic solution"" to a problem."
563,L is the least commonly ascribed attribute of L in relation to P.
564,The relationship between L and P is not the same as the relationship between P and L.
565,"Complexity is a measure of the amount of time it takes to solve a problem. There are three types of complexity: time complexity, space complexity, and memory complexity. Time complexity is the time it would take to solve the problem. Space complexity is how much memory you would need to store the result of the calculation. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of light in a vacuum, you would have to store a lot of data. Memory complexity would be how much data you could store in a given amount of space."
566,"L and P are not the same thing. L is the number of ways to solve a problem, and P is the amount of time it takes to solve that problem. There is no way to determine the value between L and P."
567,"A problem is a problem that can be solved in theory, but requires unreasonable time in practical application. For example, if you want to calculate the speed of light in a vacuum, you need to know how long it takes to travel from point A to point B. If you know the speed, you can calculate the time it takes for the light to reach point B, but if you don't know how fast the light will reach point A, then you can't calculate how much time it will take to get to point A."
568,"It depends on what you mean by polynomial time. For example, if you have a problem where you have to solve it in polynomials, then the problem is NP-complete. This means that there is no algorithm that can solve it faster than the speed of light."
569,"NP is not equal to P, viewed through this lens, it is NP-hard, but it is not NP-intractable."
570,"There are a lot of problems that cannot be solved in theory, but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful."
571,"It depends on what you mean by ""problems that have polynomial-tome solutions in complexity theory"". If you mean problems that can be solved in polynomials, then the answer is yes. If you are talking about problems that are NP-complete, then yes."
572,There is no such thing as a problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time.
573,"It depends on what you mean by ""useful"" and ""intractable"". For example, if you're trying to solve a math problem, you can't just write a program to solve it for you. You have to write an algorithm to solve the problem for you, and then you have to find a way to solve that algorithm for the rest of the computers in the world. If you're talking about a problem where you can solve it in a very small amount of time, then there's a limit to how fast you can do it, and that limit is the size of the universe."
574,"It depends on what you mean by ""practical"". If you mean practical in the sense that you can solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time, then there are a number of algorithms that can be used to solve this problem. One of the most commonly used algorithms is the Taylor series. The Taylor series is an algorithm that allows you to solve a problem in polynomial time. However, it is not the only algorithm that is useful. There are many other algorithms that are also useful. For example, there are many algorithms that allow you to find the answer to a question using a lookup table. This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down. Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything, which uses very little space, but might take a long time."
575,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""not evidenced in P"". If you mean ""not proven in NP"", then the answer is no. There is no such thing as a ""decision problem"" that is not proven in P."
576,"The Presburger problem is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It has been solved in a number of ways, but it is still unsolved. There are two main ways to solve it. The first is to find a solution to the problem in a finite amount of time. The second is to prove that the problem can be solved in finite amounts of time by a computer. In the first case, the problem is easy to solve, but in the second case, it is very hard to solve. In both cases, there is a limit to how fast a computer can solve the problem. The limit is the speed at which the computer can check if the solution is correct."
577,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of a problem to which effective algorithms have provided a solution in spite of the intractability associated with the breadth of sizes. For example, let's say you want to solve the problem of finding a square that has the same area as a given circle. The problem is that you can't find a square with the same size as a circle, but you can find one with a radius greater than the radius of the circle. You can solve this problem by finding a solution to the Euclidean geometry problem."
578,"It depends on what you mean by NP-complete. If you mean a problem that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time, then the answer is yes. However, if you mean an algorithm that can solve an NP-Complete knapsack problem, then no, it is not possible."
579,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of a problem that is commonly solved by SAT handlers employing efficient algorithms. For example, let's say there are 10,000 students on the SAT. Let's also assume that each student has a score of 1/10,000. Now let's assume that the average score of each student is 1/100,000, which means that each of those students has scored 1/1000,000 in the past 10 years. This means that every time a new student is added to the SAT, the score of all the previous students goes up by one. This is a very efficient algorithm, because it only takes a small amount of time to solve the problem. However, this is not the case for every single student. There are some students whose scores are higher than average, and there are some who are lower than average."
580,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""unknown variation of arithmetic"", but I'll give it a shot. For example, if you have two numbers x and y, does x evenly divide y? The answer is either yes or no, depending on the input values. If x evenly divides y, then the answer is yes, otherwise it is 'no'."
581,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""reasonable period of time"", but I'll give it a shot. There are a number of problems that can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. For example, if you have a problem that can't be solved by brute force, then you can solve the problem by solving it by solving a series of smaller problems. The problem is that there are a lot of small problems, and you can't solve them all at once, so you have to solve them one at a time. You can solve them by solving them one by one, but it takes a long time. If you want to solve a problem quickly, you need to solve it quickly enough that you don't have to wait for the problem to get big enough to solve."
582,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""NP-complete"". There are a lot of problems that are not NP-complete. For example, there are many problems that can be solved in less than quadratic time."
583,"I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot."
584,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of computer science, there was a lot of work being done on the problem of finding a solution to the NP problem, which is the most important unsolved problem in computer science. One of the first things that was done was to try to find a way to solve NP problems in a way that would be computationally efficient. For example, if you want to solve a NP problem by solving a series of NP problems, you can try to solve it by solving each NP problem one at a time. The problem is that NP problems are very hard to solve, and there are many different ways to solve them. One way to do this is to look at other NP problems and see if you can solve them in a similar way to NP problems. This is done by looking at how many NP problems there are, and comparing them to each other. If there are more NP"
585,"I don't think there's a single person who has been the most influential in the field of algorithmic complexity theory, but there are a number of people who have done a lot of work on the topic. One of the most famous of these is Alan Turing. Turing was a mathematician who came up with the idea of the Turing Machine in the 1960s. Turing's idea was that if you have a Turing machine, you can use it to solve any number of problems. The problem is that there is no such thing as an algorithm that can solve all of these problems. There are many ways to solve these problems, but none of them are efficient."
586,"Turing invented the Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, but it included the idea of a computer program."
587,"Turing's definition of a ""computer"" was first published in 1946 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London."
588,"A Turing machine is a system of rules, states and transitions rather than a ""real"" machine. There are two purposes for a Turing machine: deciding formal languages and solving mathematical functions."

590,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but in the early days of the internet, there was a lot of work to be done to reduce the amount of time it took for a website to load. For example, if you wanted to load a page, you'd have to wait for the page to load, and then wait for it to load again, and so on. This took a long time, and it was expensive to do. So, a company would hire people to do this work for them, so that they didn't have to spend as much time waiting for pages to load and waiting for page loads."
591,"I don't know if this counts as a question, but I'd like to know who was the least influential researcher working on the complexity posed by algorithmic problems?"
592,"I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but Alan Turing invented the transistor in 1974."
593,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you some insight into the development of the calculator. The Turning calculator was the first calculator to use the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. Prior to this, calculators used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The first calculators were the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2 and the Hewlett-Packard HP-9100, introduced in 1965 and 1968 respectively. These calculators did not use trigonometry, but instead used a combination of exponentials (sin, cos, tan) in addition to trigonometrical functions (x, y, z) for multiplication and division."
594,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""the bellwether ushering in systematic studies computational complexity"", but I'll give it a shot. The first paper I can think of off the top of my head is the work of Alan Turing, which was published in the early 1960s."

For example, if you have a problem where you want to solve it in a certain amount of time, you can calculate the time it takes to solve the problem by looking at the number of steps that the computer has to take in order to solve that problem. This is called the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test."

610,"The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test (FFT) was developed in 1948 by Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. It measures the number of independent paths through the source code of a computer program. The concept is similar to the general text complexity, which is a measure of how difficult a text is to read."
611,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. The simplest way to think about it is that if you have a problem, and you can solve it in a finite amount of time, then the answer will always be the same. For example, if you want to solve a problem with a finite number of possible inputs, then you can only solve the problem in finite amounts of time. In other words, the answer is always the same, no matter how many inputs you have. The more complex the problem is, the more time it takes to solve it, and the less time it will take to solve the same problem in the same amount of space."
612,"It depends on the type of abstraction you're talking about. For example, if you want to talk about abstractions in mathematics, you might want to think of abstraction in terms of a set of axioms. In this case, you can think of an axiom as the set of rules that govern the behavior of an object. You can also think of it as a collection of rules governing the behaviour of a group of objects. For instance, you could think of a class of objects as the group of things that make up an object, and an object as the thing that makes up the object. This is an abstraction, but it's not a complete abstraction. It's just an abstraction that allows you to think about things in a certain way."
613,"There are a lot of things that can't be transformed into each other efficiently. For example, if you want to convert a binary number into a decimal number, you can't do it in the same way that you can convert a two-dimensional number to a three-dimensional one."
614,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""theoretic theorems"" but I'll give it a shot. Theorems are statements about the nature of a system. For example, if you want to know how long it takes for a ball to travel from the top of a hill to the bottom of the hill, you need to know the speed of the ball. If you know how fast the ball will travel, then you can calculate the time it will take for the ball to reach the ground. But if you don't know this, you can't calculate how fast it will travel. So you have to make an assumption that the ball is traveling at the same speed as the ground, and that the ground is the same distance away from the ball as it was when it left the hill. This is called a ""simplest"" assumption. The problem with this assumption is that it doesn't tell you anything about the system as a whole. It only tells you how"
615,"I'm not sure if this counts as input coding, but I can think of a few examples that use input coding as a concrete choice. For example, if you want to know how to do something, you can type in a command and it will do it for you. However, this is not the only way to do it. You can also write a program that does the same thing, but instead of writing a command, you write a script that tells the computer what to do."
616,"It depends on what you mean by abstraction. If you mean abstraction in the sense that you don't know what you're talking about, then there are a lot of different ways to do that. For example, if you want to know what a number is, you can write it as a function of the number of digits in the number, and then you can use that number to represent a number. But you can also write a number as the sum of the digits in a number, or as a sum of two numbers, and so on. This is called an *abstraction*. An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality."
617,"I don't know who is responsible for axiomatic complexity theory, but I do know that it was developed by Gödel."
618,"Blum's axioms are a set of rules that can be used to prove certain things about a system. For example, if a system is consistent, then there must be some truths of mathematics which can be deduced from them. However, if the system is inconsistent, then we can't deduce any truths from it. This is called the incompleteness theorem."
619,Richard Karp wrote a paper in 1972 that ushered in a new era of understanding between intractability and NP-complete problems.
620,"Karp's paper addressed a lot of problems that were previously thought to be intractable. For example, he showed that if you have a set of numbers, you can find a way to represent them in a way that is equivalent to the set of integers. He also showed that it is possible to write a program that can represent the set as a function of the number of digits in the set, and that this program can be written in the same way as any other program. He showed that there are many problems that are known to be NP-complete."

The United Kingdom was founded in 1707 by King Henry VIII of England, who was a member of the House of Hanover, which was the ruling dynasty of England at the time. He was the son of King George I of England and Queen Elizabeth I of Scotland, who were married to each other. Henry VIII was a staunch supporter of the English monarchy, and his son, George II, was the heir to the throne of England. George II was born in England, and grew up in England. When George II died, his son George III became King of Spain. George III's son, Henry IV, became the King of Portugal. When Henry IV died, Henry V became king of Spain, and King Philip II became"
711,"Los Angeles is in the lower part of the San Andreas fault. The San Andreas is one of the most active faults in the world, and is responsible for most of the earthquakes in the United States."
712,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a map of the California coast. It's not a perfect map, but it should give you a good idea of where the Californios are."
713,"The Compromise of 1850 was a series of laws passed in 1850 that dealt with the controversial issue of slavery in the United States. One of the major provisions was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which made it easier for the government to recover runaway slaves. It was passed in response to the Panic of 1837, which had resulted in a large number of runaway slaves being returned to their owners. The Fugitive Slavery Act was passed as a result of the Panic, and was intended to make it harder for slave owners to get their slaves back. It also made it more difficult to prosecute slave owners who did not arrest their slaves. If a slave owner failed to arrest a runaway slave, they would be fined $1,000. If the slave owner did arrest the slave, he would receive $10 if the slave was returned, but only $5 if the fugitive was freed. This amounted to a legal form of bribery."
714,"California was not admitted to the Union as a slave state, it was admitted as a free state."
715,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. Before California became a state in 1850, it was part of Mexico. The state of Baja California was ruled by the Teotihuacan Empire, which was the successor state to the Mexican Empire. It was governed by the Governor of California, who was appointed by the Mexican government in 1849. The governor of California was elected by the state legislature, and was the head of the state government for the duration of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). After the war, California became part of the United States."
716,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there was a dispute between the Mexican government and the state of California in the late 19th century. There were a number of factors that led to the dispute, but the most prominent one was the Mexican-American War. In 1846, the United States and Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave Mexico control of Alta California and New Mexico to the U.S. The treaty also gave California to Mexico in exchange for the territory of Texas. In response to the treaty, the Mexican governor of California, Pio Pico, left the state. Pico had been a staunch supporter of independence from Mexico, and wanted to establish a Mexican state in California. However, Pico was opposed to the annexation of Texas by Mexico. This led to a series of conflicts between Pico and Mexico."
717,"It's the line of the Missouri Compromise, which was used to divide the slave and free states west of the Mississippi River."
718,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of a bill that was passed in 1805. In 1805, the House of Representatives passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which banned the practice of slavery in the United States. This bill was passed by the House on September 24, 1789. The next day, the Senate agreed too. The bill was then sent to the President, who signed it into law."
719,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of the California Gold Rush, there were a lot of problems with the Gold Rush. First of all, there was no way to get to California from the East Coast of the United States. The Gold Rush started in 1849 and ended in 1851, and the first Gold Rush towns were established in the Sierra Nevada in 1859. The first towns in California were founded in the 1850s and 1860s, but they were not the first towns to be founded in California. In 1859, the city of San Francisco was founded, and it was the first town in California to be named after a person. The city of Los Angeles was founded in 1869, and was the second city in California, after San Francisco. There were a number of reasons for this, but one of the main reasons was that there was a shortage of labor in the mining industry."
720,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""pro-slavery"" but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of the United States, slavery was practiced primarily in the Southern United States. Slavery was practiced in the South because it was the most profitable form of labor in the country. Slaves were used on large plantations and small farms as the primary form of labour. The South was the only place in the world where slavery was legal, so it was called ""The Southern Place on Earth"" because of its proximity to the Mississippi River, which was the source of most of the slave trade. The North, on the other hand, did not have a large population of slaves, so they were called ""Free-Soilers"" because they were opposed to the practice of slavery in the North."
721,The Pico Act of 1859 was an attempt to secede from the Union and join the Confederate states. It was signed by the State Governor John B. Weller and approved overwhelmingly by voters in the California State Legislature. However the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote.
722,"The Pico Act was passed by the California State Legislature in 1859. It was signed by the State Governor John B. Weller and approved overwhelmingly by voters in the proposed ""Territory of Colorado"". The vote was nearly perfectly split along party lines, with only three Republicans voting in favor (Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, Don Young of Alaska and Chris Smith of New Jersey) and three Democrats voting nay (Travis Childers of Mississippi, Allen Boyd of Florida, and Parker Griffith of Alabama)."
723,"The Pico Act was passed by the California State Legislature in 1859. It was signed by the State Governor John B. Pico. The bill was supported by the majority of Democrats in Congress, while the majority voted against it."
724,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In 1805, the United Provinces of New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia attempted to secede from the United States. They failed to do so due to a number of reasons. The first was that New York was not a state, but a territory of the United Kingdom. The second was that the territory was too large. The difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process."
725,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In 1895, the United States passed the Alien and Sedition Act, which made it illegal for the federal government to prosecute people for crimes against the state. The act was passed by the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate."
726,The Governor of California in 1895 was William Howard Taft. Taft was the first governor of California as a state in the U.S. He was also the first California Governor to resign.
727,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can tell you a little bit about the election of 1859. There were two major parties in the United States at the time, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Republican Party was the largest party in the country, and had the majority of seats in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Presidency. The Democratic Party was dominated by the Whigs, who controlled both the House and the Senate. The Whigs controlled the Presidency, but the Democrats controlled the Senate and the House. In 1859, John Brown's raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in what is now West Virginia (at the time part of the state of Virginia) sent shock waves through the South. Although Brown was quickly captured and executed, the incident had a profound effect on the 1860 presidential election. When Abraham Lincoln won over three Democratic Party candidates, it triggered Southern secession."
728,"Latham Milton was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He was born in Mayfield, New South Wales."
729,The Los Angeles Times was the first newspaper to define Southern California. It was created in 1881. It is the second largest newspaper in the United States.
730,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you might be interested in this answer by /u/commiespaceinvader."
731,"The Times changed its definition of the word ""newspaper"" from ""news"" to ""information"". The change was a result of the publication of the first edition of the New York Times, which was published on January 1, 1788. The Times was founded in 1785 as the Daily Universal Register. It is the earliest newspaper still being published."
732,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""county"", but I'll give it a shot."
733,"I don't know the answer to your question, but I can give you an idea of what the definition of Southern California was at the time of California's statehood in 1850. At the time, California was divided into seven counties: Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, San Francisco, San Mateo, and San Diego Counties. Each of these counties had their own borders, and each county had its own population. In 1850, Los Angeles County was one of the first counties of California. The other counties were San Diego County, Orange County, and Santa Clara County."
734,"I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but you might be interested in this answer by /u/commiespaceinvader."
735,"The definition of Southern California was changed in 1990 to include the Inland Empire, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, as well as the City of Los Angeles."
736,"The California Times was founded in 1881. It was originally a weekly paper but now printed daily. It is published in Los Angeles, California."
737,The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a good example of this.
738,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but the American Automobile Association (AA) used to have two divisions, the Automobile Manufacturers' Association (AMCA) and the American Society of Automotive Engineers (ASAE). The AA merged with the AMCA in the 1950s to form the present-day Automobile Club of America (ACCA)."
739,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you some insight into the politics of California at the time. At the time of the Civil War, California was one of the most populous states in the Union, with a population of about 2.5 million, and a population density of about 1.2 million people per square mile. This meant that there were a lot of people in Southern California who wanted to secede from the Union and join the Confederate States of America. However, this did not happen. California joined the war to and helped the North (the Union) and sent many troops east to fight the Confederacy. Northern California, on the other hand, was very pro-Union, and many people in Northern California thought the South was right. Southern California had a large number of Southerners who moved to California during the Gold Rush, but they were a minority group in the state. Southern Democrats were sympathetic to the Confederacy and Southern Republicans"
740,The Himalayas are the tallest mountain range in the world.
741,"It depends on what you mean by ""desert"". The Mojave Desert is a desert in the north of Los Angeles County. The San Gabriel Mountains are a mountain range in southern California, in the United States. They are north of the Los Angeles River and south of the Santa Clara River."
742,The California Automobile State Association (CASA) is the governing body of the sport of auto racing in California.
743,The Southern California Automobile Club is a non-profit organization that promotes the sport of auto racing in Southern California. The club was founded in 1990.
744,"""North of the Tehachapis"" is a term used to refer to a region of the North American continent. It is used to describe the region of North America that includes Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States."
745,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. California is divided into three regions: North, Central, and South. North and Central are the two main areas of the state. They are the areas with the highest mountains and the most people. South and South are the regions with the lowest mountains. They have the lowest population."
746,"Los Angeles has a population density of 25,904 people per square mile, which is higher than any other city in the United States."
747,"There is a lot of undeveloped land in Southern California, but it's not as much as you might think. There's a lot more land in the Central Valley than there is in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example."
748,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example. I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a very small town, but it had a lot of people living in it. One day I was walking down the street, and I saw a house. I walked over to it, and there was a family living there. I asked them, and they said, ""Oh, that's my house."""
749,"Southern California is known for it's palm trees, beaches and Mediterranean-like weather."
750,"It depends on what you mean by ""within the urban area of Southern California"". If you mean the area around Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco, then the answer is pretty much the same. There are a few exceptions to this rule, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and the San Fernando Valley."
751,"Chicago is the second most populated city in the United States, followed by New York. It is also the biggest city of California."
752,"There are a lot of different areas in Los Angeles, but I'll try to give you a general overview of the major ones. Downtown is the center of the city, and it's the most densely populated area in the city. It's also the largest city in the state, and has the highest density of people per square mile. East Los Angeles is the heart of the area, and is home to many of the most famous movie studios and music venues in the country. West Hollywood is also home to the largest number of movie studios in the world, as well as many of Hollywood's most famous actors, actresses, and musicians. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the general gist of it."
753,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""international metropolitan region"", but I'll give it a shot."
754,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. There are a lot of factors that go into urbanization, but one of the most important is the amount of land available. If you want to live in a city, you need to have enough land to build a house, a car, a school, a hospital, a police station, a library, etc. You need to be able to get all of these things from one place to another. This means that you need a lot more land than you can get from one city to another, which means you need more people to build these things. The problem with this is that there are only so many places you can build things, and so many people you can hire to build them."
755,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a map of the major cities along I-15 and I-215."
756,"Los Angeles County is not a separate metropolitan area. It is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area, which is a group of metropolitan areas over five counties in Southern California."
757,"I live in Orange County, CA, and commute to work in Los Angeles."
758,"I can't speak to the other counties, but I can speak to San Bernardino. San Bernardino County is a very large county in southeastern California, with a population of over 2 million. The county was mostly rural until the early 20th century. After the Civil War, the county began to grow and become more urbanized. During the 1950s and 1960s, San Bernardino became one of the largest cities in the United States. The city of San Bernardino was the largest city in California until the 1970s."

764,Southern California has a Mediterranean climate with warm and dry summers and mild winters. The climate is tropical savanna.
765,"It depends on what you mean by ""low end of the temperature range"". For example, if you mean ""below freezing"", then it depends on how cold the air is, and how long it takes for it to reach that temperature."
766,"It depends on where you are in the US. In the Southwest, it is very common to see snowfall in the winter months, but it is not as common in the spring and summer. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of moisture in the air, which makes it more likely for snow to fall."
767,"It depends on what you mean by ""high end"" and ""low end""."
768,"California has a Mediterranean climate with warm, wet summers and cold, dry winters. The deserts in the south have very hot summers and mild winters."
769,"It depends on where you are in the world. If you're in the middle of nowhere, it can be very hot. If it's in a desert, it's very cold."
770,"It depends on where you are in the world. If you're in the middle of a desert, it's going to be a lot colder than if you're on the equator."
771,"It depends on what you mean by ""rare"". There are a lot of species that are rare in the Southeast, but there are also a lot that are very common. For example, there are a number of species of sea turtles that are endemic to the Southeast."
772,"I don't know what you mean by ""collection of landscapes"", but I'll give it a shot. I grew up in Southern California, so I know what I'm talking about."

775,The Transverse Range is the largest mountain range in the world. The Himalayas are the next largest.
776,"It depends on what you mean by ""tail off"". The Himalayas, for example, are the result of the collision of the Eurasian and African plates. The Eurasian plates collided with the African plate, creating the Himalaya."

778,The Atlantic Ocean has the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.
779,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""large and small interior valleys"", but I'll give it a shot. There are two types of ocean: the deep ocean, and the shallow ocean. The deep ocean is the ocean that is below the surface of the Earth. The deepest part of the ocean is called the Mariana Trench."
780,"I don't know about the rest of the country, but I live in an area that has the most diversity of anywhere in the country."
781,"Earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's crust. They happen when two tectonic plates (parts of the crust) shift beneath each other. Earthquakes can occur anywhere on the Earth, but they are most common in the Pacific Ocean."

783,The magnitude of the Northridge earthquake was 6.7 on the Richter scale.
784,"The 1994 Northridge Earthquake was one of the most devastating natural disasters in the history of the United States. The earthquake had a strong moment magnitude at around 6.7, which is the highest magnitude ever recorded in North America. It killed more people than any other earthquake in recorded history."
785,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you a rough estimate. The earthquake had a strong moment magnitude at around 6.7, which means that it had a moment of acceleration of about 1.5 meters per second. That's a lot of acceleration, and it's enough to cause damage to buildings, roads, and other structures. The total cost of damage could be more than US$20 billion."
786,"The Northridge Earthquake occurred on January 17, 1994 at 04:30 Pacific Standard Time around the Los Angeles area. The earthquake had a strong moment magnitude at around 6.7, although ground acceleration was one of the highest ever recorded in North America. The magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be between 6.5 and 6.8. The damage was estimated at $20 million."

790,"There are three main types of faults that can cause earthquakes: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur in areas where the crust is being extended. Reverse faults occur where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other."
791,"There are three main types of faults that can cause an earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust) and strike-slip. Normal faults occur where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened."
792,"The San Andreas fault is one of the most famous faults in the world. It runs through the San Andreas Fault Zone, which runs through Southern California. This fault could create a large earthquake that could greatly affect Greater Los Angeles."
793,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's an article from the National Weather Service."
794,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that there are a lot of different types of earthquakes in California. The most common type of earthquake in California is a subduction zone earthquake. These are earthquakes that happen when two tectonic plates (parts of the Earth's crust) move beneath each other. In California, the two plates are the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The North American plate is moving beneath the South American plate, which is moving under the California plate. These earthquakes are called subduction zones."
795,"It depends on what you mean by ""earthquake"". Earthquakes are caused by the movement of tectonic plates under the Earth's crust. For example, the San Andreas fault in California is responsible for most of the magnitude 8.7 earthquakes in the US."
796,The San Andreas Fault is a right-moving ('dextral') strike-slip fault. This means that it is capable of producing a magnitude 8.0 earthquake.

802,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of a region that is recognized globally. In the early 20th century, the Ottoman Empire was one of the most powerful countries in the world. The Ottoman Empire controlled a lot of territory in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian Ocean. The Ottomans were also responsible for the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."
803,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. I grew up in New York City, and I can tell you that it's one of the most important cities in the world. It's the center of the world's financial industry, and it's the largest city in the United States. The city is also known for its cosmopolitan culture, and entertainment hubs, which are located around the city."
804,"California is divided into three parts: Northern California, Southern California, and the Bay Area."
805,"Southern California had a population of 22,680,010 according to the census from which year?"
806,"Southern California is known for it's palm trees, beaches and Mediterranean-like weather."
807,"It depends on what you mean by ""average growth rate"". If you mean the number of people living in a given area, then yes, that is the average growth rate. However, if you mean how many people live in a city, then that is not the average. For example, let's say you have a city of 10,000 people, and you want to increase the population of that city to 20,000. You can do this by increasing the population by 1% every year, or by adding 1,000 new people every year. This means that the city's population will grow by 1.5% per year. If you want a more specific answer, then you can look at the population density of the city. The density of a city is related to its population density, and the density of its population is proportional to the square of its area. The square of the area is the square root of the population. So, for example, if we have 10,"

810,"Southern California has a population of 26,860, 010 according to the U.S. Census Bureau."
811,"I don't know the exact numbers, but I can tell you that the number of people living in Los Angeles in 2000 was more than double what it was in 2000."
812,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the mid-19th century, there was a massive influx of immigrants to the Bay Area. These immigrants brought with them a lot of goods and services. These goods included food, clothing, and other things. The Bay Area is one of the richest regions"

The BBC is a public broadcaster, which means that it has the right to do whatever it wants with the money it receives from the public. However, the government does not have the power to force the BBC to do what it wants, so the BBC has to make its own decisions about what to do with its money. In the case of the BBC, this means that the government has to decide whether or not it should be allowed to make money from the BBC's licence fees. The government has decided that it should not be able to do this, because the BBC is an independent public broadcaster. This means that there is no way for the government to stop the BBC from making its own money."
1008,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that in the early days of BSkyB, there was no such thing as a ""basic"" channel. You had to have a subscription to get the basic channels, and you had to pay for the premium channels."
1009,"The High Court ruled that Microsoft's use of the term ""SkyDrive"" infringed on Sky's right to use the name ""Sky""."
1010,BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement in December 2014.
1011,Sky Drive is a cloud storage service. It is used by businesses to store files on their computers. Microsoft has been using Sky Drive for a long time.
1012,"Sky Drive Pro is a cloud storage service. It has been around for a long time, and was originally called Sky1. It was renamed to SkyDrive Pro in 2008, and then to Skydrive Pro in 2010."

1019,"The first Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was Sir John Flynn. In 1912, he was asked by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of people living in the Northern Territory. His report about it led to the creation of an Australian Inland Mission (AIM). The AIF was initially run by a small group of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. By 1926, it had become a network of ten nursing clinics. The first AIF Chief of Staff was Major General Sir John Ferguson."
1020,"I can't speak for the rest of the network, but I can speak for PBS. In March of 2007, PBS announced that it would no longer be a part of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, PBS, CW, etc.). This was due to a number of reasons, but one of the main reasons was that PBS was no longer able to afford to pay NBC and ABC for the rights to broadcast their programming. The reason for this was that NBC was able to negotiate a lower price for their programming than PBS, and PBS was unable to do the same. PBS left open the possibility to re-offer the network."
1021,"BSkyB had a contract with Virgin Media that required Virgin to carry certain channels. This contract expired in 2013, and Virgin didn't want to carry those channels anymore."
1022,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""substantially more value""."
1023,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""substantially more value"". Video on Demand is a free service that you can use to watch any video you want. It's not a subscription service, it's just a way to watch video on demand."
1024,BSkyB and Virgin Media have an agreement over the carriage of Sky Channels on cable TV.
1025,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a list of channels that were always available on the network."

1040,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""connecting different Sky Q boxes"" but I'll give it a shot. There are two ways to connect a Sky Q box. The first is to connect it to a satellite dish. The satellite dish is the one that broadcasts the TV. The second way is to use a cable box."
1041,"It depends on what you mean by ""when is Sky going to introduce UHD broadcasts""."
1042,The new Sky Q products are expected to be available in the fall of 2016.
1043,"It's not a router, it's a satellite dish."
1044,There are a couple of reasons. The first is that the HDMI cable is too small to fit into the box. The second reason is that there is no HDMI cable in the box itself.
1045,"I'm not sure what you mean by disconnecting different Sky Q boxes, but I'll try to answer your question. When you connect a Sky Q box to the internet, it sends a signal to your router. The router then sends the signal back to your TV. If you disconnect the box, the signal is no longer being sent back to the router, so it stops sending the signal."
1046,"It depends on what you mean by ""no longer display UHD broadcasts""."
1047,"BSkyB's standard definition broadcasts are compliant with MPEG-2, MPEG-3, and MPEG-4-2."
1048,"It depends on what you mean by ""optional soundtracks"". If you mean ""soundtracks that are not included in the movie"", then the answer is yes."
1049,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's what it looks like:"
1050,Sky+HD uses a proprietary operating system called SkyOS. SkyOS is a privately-owned operating system currently in production.
1051,"It depends on what you mean by ""standard"". There are a lot of different standards, but the most common ones are MPEG-2, MPEG-3, and MPEG-4."
1052,ELI5: What box is required to view MPEG-3?
1053,Sky+HD is not a proprietary system. It's a service that allows you to buy a subscription to Sky+HD.
1054,"I can't think of a channel that didn't use looping, but I can think of one that did."
1055,"It depends on what you mean by ""soundtracks"". For example, if you mean a soundtrack for a TV show, then yes, there is a soundtrack. If you mean an audio book, then there is no soundtrack."
1056,Sky Digital was launched on 27 June 1983 in the United Kingdom and the United States.
1057,Satellites were used to transmit and receive television signals. The first satellite was launched on 27 June 1983 in the United Kingdom and later renamed Sky Channel on 16 January 1984.
1058,Satellites are expensive to build and maintain. It's not like you can just build a new satellite and expect it to work. You need a lot of money to launch a satellite.
1059,"It depends on what you mean by ""digital service"". If you're talking about a cable TV service, then the answer is probably no. If you mean a satellite service, the answer would probably be yes."
1060,"It's not a satellite, it's a cable. The cable is attached to the satellite and the satellite is connected to the cable."
1061,"Aerospace Engineer here. The Astra 2A was used by the US Navy in the late 70s and early 80s. The first Astra was built in the mid-1970s, and the second in the early 1980s. In the late 80s, it was upgraded to the Astra 3A."
1062,"It's not that they couldn't do it, it's that they didn't have the money to do it."
1063,"It depends on what you mean by ""digital service"". For example, if you're talking about a cable TV service, there are a lot of channels that are still being broadcast over the air. If you're asking about a satellite service, then there's a lot more."
1064,"Sputnik 1 was the first satellite to go around the Earth. It was launched on 4 October 1957 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. It did 1,440 orbits of the Earth during this time."
1065,"BSkyB has been offering HDTV for a long time, but it was only recently that they started offering it to their customers."
1066,"I don't know the exact number, but I can tell you that there were a lot of people who registered to receive the HD service prior to launch."
1067,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that the problem was not with the set top box manufacturer, but with the cable provider. The problem was with the provider of the cable, which was not the cable company, but the satellite company. The cable company had a contract with the satellite provider to provide a service to the UK. The satellite provider was a company called Sky, which is a subsidiary of Comcast. It used to be called British Sky Broadcasting Limited, BSkyB and Sky."
1068,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a link to the BBC article:"
1069,The total number of homes Sky announced that had Sky+HD in March of 2012 was around 2.5 million.
1070,"BSkyB didn't fail to launch it's HDTV service, they just didn't have the money to do so."
1071,"It depends on what you mean by ""supply issues"". In the UK, there are a number of different suppliers to BSkyB, and they all have their own issues. For example, in the early days of the company, there was a single supplier that made all of the equipment for the company. However, over time, the company changed hands, and now there are many different suppliers that make the equipment. This is why there are so many different types of equipment that you can buy from different manufacturers."
1072,"It depends on what you mean by ""register to receive the HD service prior to launch""."
1073,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a link to an article about it."
1074,"The total number of homes with Sky+HD is 3,222,000."
1075,BSkyB did not announce it's intention to replace it's free-to-air digital channels. They did announce that they would be switching to a subscription service.
1076,"It's not a subscription service, it's a streaming service."
1077,"I don't know what platform they were planning on launching on, but I can tell you that they weren't going to be launching on a single platform. They were going to launch on multiple platforms."
1078,TLT:Telewest was rebranded as T-Mobile.
1079,"Sky Sports is owned by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The BBC owns the rights to broadcast the Olympics, the World Cup, the Paralympics, the Summer Olympics, and many other international sporting events. The BBC also owns a number of other sports channels, such as BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC TV."
1080,BSkyB announced it's intention to improve it's free-to-air digital channels in the United Kingdom in December 2005. The service replaced the analogue signal in the UK in 2012.
1081,"It's not a free service, it's a subscription service."
1082,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot."
1083,"Virgin Media is the name of a company in the United Kingdom. It was formed as Virgin Games Ltd. in 1981. The company became much larger after purchasing the budget label, Mastertronic in 1987. In 1994 it was renamed Virgin Interactive. In 2006 it was rebranded as Virgin Media."
1084,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. I used to work for a cable company, and one of the things we had to do was make sure that all of our ads were on the same channel. So, for example, if you wanted to advertise on ABC, you would have to buy a 30-second ad on the ABC channel, and then you'd have to pay the cable company for that ad. If you didn't want to buy that ad, you had to buy it on the other cable company's channel, which would have cost you a lot of money."
1085,Free-to-air broadcasts are encrypted using a protocol called WEP. WEP stands for Wireless Encryption Protocol.
1086,"It depends on what you're trying to encrypt. For example, if you want to encrypt a message, you need to encrypt it."
1087,"It depends on what you mean by ""encrypt"". For example, if you want to send a text message, you can send it to a computer, and the computer will send it back to you. However, if the message is encrypted, the computer doesn't know how to decrypt it, so it can't send the message back to the sender."
1088,"There is no universal band that digital recievers will receive free to air channels on. There are a number of different bands that can be used for different things. For example, in the United States, there is a band that is reserved for voice communications. In Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South America, the frequency band from 1880 MHz to 1900 MHz is used. In the United Kingdom, the band is 1920-1930 MHz."
1089,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a link to a video that explains it pretty well."
1090,"It depends on what you mean by ""encrypted"". If you mean encrypted in the sense that you can't decrypt it, then yes, it does require a decryption key. However, that's not the only thing that needs to be decrypted. For example, if you want to send a message to a friend, you need to know the recipient's private key. If you want the recipient to know your public key, then you need the public key. And so on."
1091,"It depends on what you mean by unencrypted. If you mean unencrypted in the sense that you can't decrypt it, then yes, you can. However, if you mean encrypted in such a way that it can't be decrypted, then no, you cannot decrypt it."
1092,"It depends on where you are. If you are in the US, it will be on the 700 MHz band. If it is in Europe, it is on the 1800 MHz band, and so on."
1093,"It depends on what you're trying to decrypt. For example, if you want to decrypt a video file, you need to know what file it is, and what file format it's in. If you don't know, then you can't decrypt it. You can decrypt the file, but you won't be able to decrypt the video."
1094,"In the middle of the dish, there is an antenna. The antenna is connected to the dish by a cable. The cable is attached to the antenna, and the cable is hooked up to the satellite dish. The satellite dish is powered by a coaxial cable, which is a type of coax cable."
1095,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you a brief overview of the history of the Primier league in Finland. The Primier League was established in 1969, and the Finnish Football Association (FIFA) was formed in 1969. The FFA was the governing body of the Finnish football league, and it was based in Helsinki, Finland. In 1969, the FFA decided to create a new league, the Finnish Premier League, which would be the successor to the Finnish League. This league would be called the Finnish Superliga, and would be run by the Finnish FA. In 1971, the league was renamed the Finnish First League, and in 1972, it became the Finnish Second League."
1096,"The rights to the Primer League are owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Australian Football League (AFL). The AFL is the governing body of the Australian football league, while the AFL is a governing body for the Australian soccer league."
1097,ITV increased their yearly offer for control of the rights to broadcast the Primer League to a total of £1.5 billion.
1098,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example. During the first World War, there was a series of battles between the US and the Soviet Union. The US won the series, and the Soviets won the war, but the US lost the war as well. In the end, the US defeated the Soviets. It was broadcast on the same evening."
1099,"I can't speak for the rest of the Premier League, but I can tell you that BSkyB paid a lot of money for the rights to the EPL. The EPL is one of the most popular football leagues in the world, and it's the most watched football league on the planet. It's also the most important football league in Europe, because it has the biggest number of teams, the best players, and the most money to be made from it."
1100,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of the internet, there were a lot of companies that didn't want to give up their intellectual property rights, because they didn't think they'd be able to make money off of it. For example, if you wanted to make a video game, you'd have to pay for the rights to make the game, and you couldn't do that if you didn't own the copyright to the game. So, you had to get permission from the people who made the game before you could make it, and if you got permission from them before you made it, you could't make it without paying for it."
1101,"I can't speak for the rest of the world, but in the UK, the Premier League is broadcast on Sky Sports, which is a pay-per-view service. This means that you have to pay for the right to watch the games on the channel, which means that it costs a lot of money to get the rights to broadcast the games."
1102,"I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example. During the Civil War, there was a series of battles between the British and the Americans. The British won, but the Americans won. The Americans won the series, and the British won the war, but lost the war."
1103,"The rights to broadcast the Premier League have been held by Sky Sports since the 1998-99 season, with highlights being shown by STV's Scotsport. The current broadcasting rights are owned by SBS."
1104,Sky has an operating license from the BBC.
1105,"BSkyB doesn't have an EPG. It's just a list of all the channels that are available on the Sky network. If you want to watch a specific channel, you have to pay for it."
1106,"BSkyB does not have the power to veto the presence of channels on their EPG. However, they do have the ability to block channels from appearing on the EPG if they want."
1107,"BSkyB doesn't have any control over a channel's content. They have a license to broadcast it, but they don't have to pay for it."
1108,"BSkyB does not have any control over the picture quality of a channel. However, they do have a lot of control over how the channel is presented to the public. For example, the BBC has a contract with BSkyB that says that they can only show certain shows at certain times of the day. This means that if the BBC wants to show a certain show at a certain time of day, they can show it at that time. If the BBC doesn't want to show the same show at the same time, then they can't show that show at all."
1109,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that the BBC lost its licence to operate a television station in the UK in 2011. The BBC lost the licence because they were unable to pay the licence fee to the BBC, which they had to do in order to operate the service."
1110,"There is no such thing as a ""veto over the presence of channels on their EPG""."
1111,"BSkyB doesn't have the power to block channels, but they do have the right to refuse to show certain channels. For example, if they don't want to show a certain channel, they can't block it."
1112,"It depends on what you mean by ""doesn't require a fee to use""."
1113,BSkyB's digital service was launched on 5 December 2018. The service replaced the analogue signal in the United Kingdom in 2012.
1114,"BSkyB's digital service was launched on 5 December 2018, and is available on Digital TV by Satelite, Cable, Colette, and Terrestrial (Freeview) Platforms."
1115,"BSkyB's iPlayer was originally called the Integrated Media Player (IMP), the Interactive Media Player, and then MyBBCPlayer. The iPlayer service was released to the public on 25 December 2007."
1116,"BSkyB was originally owned by the British Broadcasting Company Ltd. It was formed on 18 October 1922 by British and American electrical companies doing business in the United Kingdom. In 1922, the BBC merged with the British Electric Company Ltd (BECL) to form British Sky Broadcasting Limited (BSBCL). The BBCL was a subsidiary of the BECL, which was the largest electrical company in the UK at the time. In 1923, BSCL was sold to the British Telecommunications Corporation (BT) for £1,000,000. BT had a monopoly on the cable television market in England and Wales, and BSKB was the first satellite TV provider to compete with BT. BT was also the first cable television provider to launch in the US, with the launch of DirecTV in 1949."
1117,"It depends on what you mean by ""digibox"". If you mean a digibox, then the answer is no."
1118,"BSkyB's digital service was unofficially launched on October 10, 2016 in Portsmouth first."
1119,"BSkyB is owned by Comcast. Comcast is the largest cable company in the United States, and has a monopoly on cable TV in the U.S."
1120,"I don't know the answer to your question, but I can give you a rough estimate of how many digiboxes were used."
1121,BSkyB stopped giving away free digiboxes in 2008.
1122,TLT:Telewest merged with Telewest Global in 2006 to form Virgin Media.
1123,"TLT:Telewest was acquired by Telewest Global in 2006. In 2007, the company was renamed to T-Mobile."
1124,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that Virgin Media has been doing a lot of programming for the last few years, and they've been doing it in a very different way than they did in the past. In the past, Virgin Media was primarily focused on TV and radio, but in the last couple of years, they've done a lot more programming for internet, mobile, and TV."
1125,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""one linear HD channel Virgin Media carried from November 2006 to July 2009""."
1126,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that the BBC HD channel will be available on Virgin Media in the future. BBC HD replaced it."
1127,NTL Telewest was rebranded from Virgin Media in 2006.
1128,"It's not that Virgin Media ignored linear channels, it's that they didn't have the money to pay for them."
1129,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""one linear SD channel Virgin Media carried from November 2006 to July 2009""."
1130,"I can't think of any, but I can think of a few."
1131,BSkyB's direct-to-home satellite service was available to around 1.5 million homes in 2010.
1132,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. BSkyB said they could reach a certain number of people, but they didn't say how many people they'd reach. They said they'd be able to reach as many people as they wanted, but not as many as they thought they could."
1133,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. BSkyB has a target of 10.4 million subscribers in the UK. The target is based on the number of people who subscribe to the service, not the total number of subscribers. So, if they have 10 million subscribers, then they will have reached their target. If they don't, they'll have missed it."
1134,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of BSkyB, there was a lot of competition between the BBC and Sky. The BBC had a monopoly on TV in the UK, so they were able to charge a lot more for the right to show their shows. This meant that the BBC had to compete with the BBC for viewers, and the BBC was able to get away with it for a long time. However, as time went on, the BBC became more and more dominant in the TV market, and they started to lose out to the BBC in terms of viewers. As a result, in the early years of the BBC, it became increasingly difficult for the BBC to keep up with the competition, and in the mid-to-late 1980s, it was finally able to beat the BBC by a significant margin."
1135,"I can't speak for other areas of Europe, but I can speak for the United States. I used to work for a cable company in the 1980s and 1990s, and I can tell you that there was a huge drop in the number of subscribers in the U.S. in the late 80s and early 90s."
1136,BSkyB's direct-to-home satellite service was unavailable to them in 2010.
1137,BSkyB said they couldn't reach a certain percentage of the population because they didn't have the infrastructure to do so.
1138,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I'll give it a shot. In the early days of BSkyB, there was a lot of competition in the TV market. The BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 were all competing with each other for viewers, and they were all trying to get as many viewers as possible. As a result, the BBC had a monopoly on TV in the UK for a long time. This meant that they were able to charge a lot more for the same amount of programming, which meant that there were more people watching TV than there were people wanting to watch TV. This means that the BBC could charge more for more programming, and therefore more people watched TV. However, as time went on, more and more people started watching TV, and the BBC started to lose viewers."
1139,"I can't speak for the rest of Europe, but in the UK, the BBC was the most popular free-to-air broadcaster."
1140,"Alec Shelbrooke was the Secretary of the Treasury during the Great Depression. He was responsible for setting up the Department of Labor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labour Statistics). He was also responsible for the creation of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The NLRB was the government agency responsible for collecting taxes and spending the money collected. The NBS was the agency that collected taxes, spent the money, and reported the results to the federal government. In the 1930s, the NBS and the NLRB were unable to collect enough taxes to meet the demands of the growing economy. As a result, the government was unable to meet its obligations to collect taxes, spend the money it collected, and report the results of the tax collection."
1141,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a list of things that can be purchased with food stamps."

1145,"Shelbrooke was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. He was the leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons at the time of his death. He served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. Borden was the Prime Minister of Canada during the Second World War, and Shelbrooke served as his Chief of Staff. When Borden died in 1945, he was succeeded by William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was a staunch supporter of the war effort. As a result, the Conservative Party was split into two factions, the Progressive Conservatives and the New Democratic Party. The Progressive Conservatives were the party in power during the war, while the New Democrats were in power after the war. The New Democratic party was the party that came to power after Borden's death. It was created by Mulroney's government and was not very popular among the Canadian public."

1148,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an example of what the benefits agency thought sports channels should be included on a TV bill. In the early 2000s, there was a big push to get cable companies to include sports channels on their TV bills. The idea was that it would make it easier for people to switch to a different cable provider if they had to pay more for a sports channel. However, there were a lot of problems with this idea. First of all, cable companies didn't want to pay extra for sports channels. Second, sports channels are expensive to produce and broadcast. Third, sports networks are often owned by the same people that own the cable companies that broadcast them. This means that they can charge a lot more for the rights to broadcast sports than they can for other types of programming."

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to life in prison. However, this was not the end of the story. There were other cases, such as the case of Thomas Jefferson, where he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. In these cases, the court proceedings were held to determine whether or not Jefferson was guilty of treason."

The most famous of these riots occurred on the night of 30 June, 1861, when a group of about 3,000 miners marched to Lambing Flat led by a brass band and two men carrying the roll up banner. They forced the Chinese to leave the area and set up camp near Roberts' farm at Currowang, 20km away. They then went to the Back Creek diggings and set fire to more tents.

The Goldfields were the first gold fields in Australia, and they were discovered in 1846. Gold was discovered in the area in 1843, and a mine was built soon after. By 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns. Life on the Gold Fields was hard, water was scarce, fresh fruit and vegetables were not available, and food was scarce. The miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for gold, or use a method called dry blowing. Dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind."
1175,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can give you some background on the history of Chinese gold mining in Australia. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, China was one of the largest gold producing nations in the world, and was a major exporter of gold to the rest of the world. During the Gold Rush of the 1850s and 1860s, many Chinese people came to Australia to search for gold. One of the first Chinese miners to arrive in Australia was Zheng He, who arrived in Melbourne in 1851. Zheng He was the first person to discover gold in Australia, but he was not the first to mine it. In 1859, the Great Victoria Mine was opened at Clunes, Victoria. The mine was the largest in Australia at the time, with a total of 1.5 million tonnes of gold being mined. The Great Victoria mine was closed in 1914."

1177,"The 1857 Gold Rush was the first major gold rush in Australia, but it was not the only one. There were many others during the next 30 years. The first gold rush was in New South Wales in 1851, and the second one was in Victoria in 1857. In 1851 there was a gold rush at Clunes, Victoria, which attracted a large number of people to search for gold. But by 1852 most miners had left Ballarat and rushed to the new goldfields at Bendigo. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich. The population grew across South East Australia and made great wealth and industry. The gold rushes of 1851 and 1857 were not the first gold rushes in Australia."

There were several angry and violent protests in Victoria and New South Wales. The miners were angry and on the night of July 14, 1,000 miners attacked the police camp. The police fired their guns and rode their horses into the miners. They then went to the Back Creek diggings and set fire to more tents.

1179,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can give you an idea of what it was like to be a Chinese miner in Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There were a number of factors that contributed to the poor working conditions for Chinese miners in Ireland and China. The first thing to note is that the conditions in Ireland were very different from those in China. In Ireland, most of the people who worked in the mines were indentured servants. This meant that they had no rights to the land they worked on. In China, however, they had the right to work on their own land as long as they worked for the government. The problem with indentured servitude in Ireland was that it meant that the government had no right to force you to work for them. This was a big problem for the Chinese miners who worked on the gold fields in Ireland. The Chinese miners worked in large groups of 30 - 100 men. They were"

The TAR was originally built as a narrow gauge line, but was later converted to a standard gauge line in the mid-19th century."
1351,Rail gauge is the distance from the inside of one rail to the outside of the other.
1352,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that there was a narrow-gauge railway that ran from Melbourne to Adelaide in the early 1900s.

For example, the Manchester to Bury line had a gauge of 1.5m, while the London to Liverpool line was 1.8m. These power lines were designed to be able to handle a wide range of voltages. The system used was 6,600 Volt, 25 Hz alternating current from overhead lines. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1,200 V DC system chosen for the Liverpool to Manchester line."

1357,"I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I can tell you that the narrow gauge lines were demolished in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The main reason for this was due to the closure of the Southern Railway. The Southern Railway was one of the largest railway companies in the world at the time, and had a monopoly on passenger rail in the UK. The loss of passenger rail meant that the company had to sell off a lot of its assets in order to pay off its debts. This meant that many of the railway's assets were sold off, and many of these assets were used to build the London Underground. As part of this process, a number of railway lines were dismantled. The majority of these lines were located in the East End of London, and the majority of them were dismantled in the West End of the city. The East End is the most famous example of this, as it is the only part of the Victoria line that is not Underground"

The Netherlands, however, did not want to give up their claim to the East Indies, so they continued to fight the Spanish until 1615, when they finally won the war. During the war, there were a number of rebellions in the Netherlands. The most famous of these was the Seven Years' War, which lasted from 1615-1618. During this war, the Netherlands attempted to establish its own settlement, but failed."

The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings. They were attacked by the British Army. Over 30 miners were killed. There were several angry and violent protests in Victoria and New South Wales. In 1854 the miners were working in the goldfields (the area where gold was being found) became very angry about the cost of a gold mining license. The government began to tax the miners by making them pay for ""Miner's Licence"". The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament.

1370,"I can't answer your question directly, but I can give you some background on the Eureka Stockade. The Stockade was a stockade that was used to hold miners in the Goldfields. It was set up in 1854 to house miners who had been working in the goldfields for a long time. In 1854, a group of miners, led by James Lalor, revolted against the stockade. This was because they felt that they were being exploited by the government, and that the government was not doing enough to help them. The stockade was used as a way to intimidate the miners into not revolting again, and to prevent them from revolting against the government again. As a result, many of the miners were killed, and a number of other people were injured. The government changed the laws, and miners were able to elect people to Parliament. However, this was not enough to stop the miners from continuing to work in the mines, and the"

The main leaders of the rebellion were the Rajputs of Jhansi and the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. The Maharaja was a member of the royal family of the Mughal Empire, and was one of the most powerful men in the Indian subcontinent at the time. He was a staunch supporter of the British Crown, and had served in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars. When the British took control of India in 1857, he was forced to flee to the United States, where he was arrested and tried for treason.
