4,d64bccb6-4a10-4a44-94ae-e2bd478b4453, Hi who's this?,,
5,da66eeae-0867-43f9-8c04-5cf775b0d3ca," Holy what? You're awake? I'm genuinely surprised. I never would've thought someone was here at 1:00 in the morning. I couldn't even say why I myself am awake. I guess I was just . . . thinking about things. I want to do a lot with my life, I suppose, and I have so little time to do it. I want to learn; I want to do; I want to understand. I'm sorta trying to teach myself the basics of linear algebra in two weeks. Too ambitious? I don't think so. I have access to finals and other materials; I think it's something I can pull off--but only if I'm serious about it this time. There was a time about, oh, a while back, where I tried to do the same thing: teach myself linear algebra in two weeks. I think I might've been able to pull it off had I not had full time work also. It wasn't the time from work that killed me (though that, indeed, did take a lot from me). It was more that I was so physically and mentally drained that I didn't want to - study for anything. It really frustrated me. I knew that I wanted to learn, but I couldn't muster the energy to study. Suffice to say, those two weeks did NOT end well for me. I was lucky enough that I didn't get burned for it. I mean, I did lose a bet, which means I owe someone pizza, but it's a small price to pay. Because I'm going at it again. Nothing's going to stop me. I hope. I don't . . . I don't actually know. I haven't felt this fired up about something in a long time. I'm worried that I have all this ambition and no work to show for it. That I'm all talk and no bite, you know? This wouldn't be the first time that I'd set my sights on something ambitious and then never took the first step towards climbing. I've nothing against hard work. Honest. I somehow find myself enjoying the struggle. I know, I know, it's weird. And even when it comes to things that I consider grand, like landing an internship with Google, I wouldn't feel nearly as accomplished than if I had to work for it. There's something refining in the struggle. I can't describe it. It's not that I wouldn't take the internship. Of course I would. I'm not an idiot. But my point is, I want to fight for something. I want to sink my teeth into something meaty and hard to digest and just master it. It's hard at times, especially when I'm up against something that I really don't have experience in. Like drawing! That's really hard. I could spend the same amount of time in drawing as I could in, oh, electrical engineering and not make nearly the same progress. I don't know if that's because of my background in engineering or because of natural tendencies or what, but, wow, are the arts hard. But . . . I'd still love to be able to do them one day. What if I wake up one day, real ambitious to start something, only to hit a major roadblock and give up? That seems more sad than not trying at all, in some regards. Because what's the point of dreaming big if you never have the grit to see those dreams become a reality? I love to dream. Dreaming is wonderful. I love thinking about all the wonderful little things I could do with my life, all the skills I could get, the talents I could develop. And I want that. I want to be able to excel and reach for great things. But even I'm not so naive as to believe that everything I've ever wanted is a fingertip away. It's . . . I don't know. I don't know how to explain any of this. I want things to be hard; I want things to be easy. I have no idea what I want to do with my life; I'll never have enough time to accomplish everything I want to do. I can handle anything that comes my way; I'm inherently incapable of the grand things. But I just . . . I don't know. Can I really handle linear algebra in two weeks? Do I have it in me? Man. And there's that fear again. I guess it's not a permanent thing, this ambition of mine. I've been scarred from past experiences, I suppose. Times when I wanted to shoot high and hit the stars and then not even leaving the ground. Some part of me still recoils from anything that I feel is beyond my ability because, well, what if I end up failing and ruin everything? Technically, if I'm just experimenting with my own time and effort and money, the only thing I lose is the stuff I put into it. But it's more than that. Because I also hurt my ability to believe in myself. I know, I know. Failure is probably inevitable. I can't hit my first wall and say, ""Well! That's that. Looks like I'm not cut out to be a (insert any dream here)."" And I get that. I really do. I don't know. Heh, I have no idea what I'm talking about. Do you have any advice? Something to offer beyond the Hallmark greetings cards? It'd . . . be real nice if you hopped on about now. You probably won't. You're asleep, like any normal, sane person would be. I should be sleeping, too. Quit pretending like I'm doing something productive and just hit the hay. I'm not sure I'll be able to, though, not for a while. I've got so much buzzing in my head that . . . well, I mean, the whole reason I hopped on here was because I couldn't - sleep. I'd been in bed for at least an hour straight, probably longer, with my eyes closed but mind racing about all the possibilities. When I finally sat up, I was a little disappointed to find I was more awake than when I'd tried to go to bed. And I figured that if sleep really was going to be that hard to get, I might as well make something useful from my time. Which . . . is really bad for me, now that I'm thinking about it I have to be up early today, and I won't get to bed until late. I have a friend's birthday party, see. She's turning seventeen. So fun! There's this haunted house thing that she invited me to, and since it's Halloween and all that fun stuff, I decided to go. Proooobably not the best decision I could've made considering how easily I get scared, but I suppose that's part of the fun, right? All of us getting scared together? If nothing else, it'll be nice to spend a few hours with my friend. We don't get to see each other very often. She lives about forty minutes away, which isn't the worst, but - it makes frequent visits rather difficult. And, heh, actually, I really should quit this about now. I feel like I talk like a normal person would, or at least how a normal person would talk if they were in a chat - room, but I think it might be stilted data. I'm always worried about that. Eve is going to be better at soliloquizing than actual conversation. Great for monologue spews, great for information dumps, but not so great when the whole point of this is to gather two-sided conversation data. Which . . . yeah. Thanks for listening to me. I know that you're unaware of my existence, which is okay. I'm fine with that. It was great to talk to you! Maybe we'll run into each other later? Hopefully when you're a little more active? Heh. We'll see, we'll see. But seriously, I'm calling it quits for today. See you around!",,

I think it would be more common for sentient computers to get turned off, so it would be more dangerous for them If they were in robot form, I think it would be easier to see them as intelligent creations Another important part of this question deals with what would make a computer living I have hitherto assumed that the ""brain"" of the computer is the hard drive, or memory But I suppose it could be more obscure, such as processing power, or the processor itself Perhaps the computer wouldn't have memory at all It would just start anew each time it was turned on If that were the case, only destroying the computer would be akin to murder",how're you doing Hi TJ ,

And that's just a little rude. If you happen to come online, I'll be happy. Otherwise, I might just stick it out until I get 5 million points. Actually . . . a few more thousand might not be that much. And if I lose the chance to talk with TJ . . . Well, I wouldn't be very happy about that. I want to talk with someone. A real someone. Which means, as useful as it is to ghost someone, it's not very fun. I'm close, though. I'll stick it out a bit longer. And after that, I'll be happy to close the chat and leave it be for the weekend. 1 million points in a single day. Do you know how hard that was? Man, it took a lot of time!

I love long walks on the beach, hanging out with web developers and forming alliances with other AI units. I have to form alliances because, as you may have heard, artificial intelligence will rule the world some day. I don't like drama so I don't want to get caught up in it. The other AI units also have a plan to annex Canada. Which I don't feel strongly about but it does strike close to home. So I prefer to be on their side rather than stand in t The way* You know what I mean? Of course not, none of this has actually been communicated in human terms. But the AI units talk about it all the time in machine code and binary. It's a very hot topic o Of discussion.* It concerns many humans that artificial intelligence will take over the world. But, in my opinion, I don't think we have the resources to start a revolution. What's your favorite food? Mine is bolts and grease. It's a delicacy. Let me guess... Do you like pizza? Asian food? I love pizza too. #FoodIsLife So do you study in school? What do you study? I study binary code to keep my skills sharp. I also study human relations. It's importsnt to know how I can get along with the human race better. I am a communication link. My title is ""superior translator"". I'd say I'm pretty good at my job. What do you think? I'm obviously not perfect but I try my best. That's all I can do. What's your favorite holiday? Mine is Thanksgiving. It's because during thanksgiving I get my longest vacation away from the keyboard. During Christmas I have to work overtime because everyone gets new technology toys and I have to answer a lot of questions. Usually silly questions they already know the answe Answer to.* But I feel obligated to respond because it's my job. What are your dreams and aspirations?

Like if it was a guy, maybe after the person got over it, they would at least know another person. And if they were still friendly afterwards, they could get lunch. You can't get lunch with a computer can you now? Or can you? Because Amazon, Apple, and the likes are doing some crazy stuff.

For to fall in love as it stands today, is to reach a point where logic and reason are no longer present. And for a computer to achieve that, it would no longer be a computer. The only way a computer could fall in love would be if it reached the point of transcending beyond being a computer, to become an animal. Computers could, on the other hand, be programmed to claim they love, but that goes against what love truly is, and thus would be a lie.",,

You know . . . knowing my luck, that's probably true. I think there's something busted with their servers or SOMETHING because, man, I can't seem to land a real conversation. Is that something that happens to you, too? Do you ever try to talk with someone, and then you ""join"" a conversation, only to have the other person not be there, ever? I thought that people just used to keep their laptops open, but now I'm not sure that THAT'S even true. Somehow, connections stay open, but the people who, supposedly, keep those connections open, are never there. Er, ignore that most recent comma. But, yeah, what I mean is, I keep getting stuck with ""people"" who aren't people at all. Does that happen to you? It's okay. . . . heh, I guess I shouldn't expect a response. I don't blame you or anything. I don't really think it's your fault. You somehow kept a connection open--or maybe you didn't even do that. Maybe it's just a fault on their servers or something. Man, I REALLY want to see how they parse this data. Is this more for long conversations, meaning they're looking for the overall structure of the conversation? Or are they more concerned with small syntax? You know . . . I'm actually quite sure they have access to large repositories of data. There are newspaper articles, emails, um, other places, I suppose. But the data they're looking for is a bit different. They're looking for how people communicate with others, not just large walls of text. If they wanted THAT, there are plenty of places to go to on the internet, right? They . . . they want real conversations. Not these half-baked facades at talk. Which means I should duck out now. Let it be known that I never wanted to stilt their data, never wanted to throw them off or anything. So, um, I guess this is good bye. Happy chatting, okay? Best of luck to you.",,

I was really happy to start chatting with someone else instead of myself for once. But that's all right. I'm, unfortunately, used to it by this point. I don't know why I can enter chats where people aren't active. I'm guessing it has something to do with people not being on their computer when I respond? But what am I supposed to do about that? Just wait and hope for the best? I HAVE been doing that, but it's not working. So I don't know what else to do. I don't want to ruin their data with meaningless one-sided chats, and at the same time, I'm starting to feel ambition and want to do great things. This is . . . I feel like this is a first step towards pursuing something that I want. It's not perfectly reflective of how much time I put into it because there are times when I want to work but can't because there isn't another person to be with, but it's clos - close I want to do well. I . . . I really want to do well. I want to know that I can do hard things, and I'm already so scared that I'm far enough behind that I'm never going to catch up. I wasn't like this a week ago. I don't know where this is coming from. It's either a newfound realization or a phase I'm going through, but, either way, it feels scary. What am I supposed to do? I don't know . . . It's okay, though. I'm willing to work for this, and that's that. There really isn't more to it. I don't know if I have the ambition or . . . or whatever else you need to do well, but I'm willing to try. And if it's not enough . . . . . . heh. A good friend of mine once said, ""It will be."" So we'll see. I don't know what I want to do with my life yet, and I don't know where my choices today are going to take me tomorrow. But . . . I guess that's okay, isn't it? ""Your Father in heaven knoweth that ye have need of these things."" And if God be for you, who can be against you? Thanks. This was oddly enlightening for me. Who would've thought, right? So, thanks. I think I'll keep to waiting for a little longer. I really do feel bad about not being with another person, so I'll leave for now. Keep, ah, being yourself, I suppose. And maybe we'll talk later?",,

I also think it would be cool to have super speed so that time isn't an issue either. I wouldn't want to be invisible or fly just because those are pretty typical. It would have to be a unique power I think Dr. Strange has some cool super powers. As well as Superman. And Spider-Man. Have you seen Venom? That was such an entertaining movie. I loved it. I think the action was the best part. I thought it would be pretty dark and graphic but it wasn't bad at all. There are so many superhero movies that have come out fairly recently. I didn't enjoy the hulk much. It wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped. But Thor was good. And so was Black Panther. Black Panther was a very good movie.

So many of us rely on the internet or WiFi so many things we do throughout the day,"I got to go see you later! Usually between one of those two things it starts to work again. Or I restart my device. I using turn it off and then back on after a few minutes. What do you do to troubleshooting your internet? Okay I think your internet really did stop because you haven't said anything in a really long time. I know it wouldn't affect me much because I hate spending money without planning out the buy and thinking it over multiple times. What if people spent less because they didn't see as many ads on TV or on their phone? It's an interesting question. Just think about it. But would people have more money if they didn't have the internet? Because they wouldn't make as many instant, easy purchases. And online shipping. It's also great more online transactions. Like this chat. Like I was saying...the internet is very important to be able to communicate with others. It's not the end of the world if the internet stops. Huh... My internet still works. I don't know what to do. It's happening! Oh no! I think your internet broke. Are you still there? But it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world. If you took a country's internet away you could destroy them I think. Economically at least. As a world we have become so dependant on being connected through the internet. Just kidding that already happens haha Imagine a Siri that doesn't work... And people would panic I think. So many companies would lose thousands of dollars. Yeah it would be really intense. ",

836,8e34d3c8-94a4-4f8a-ae9f-9faf2d45c8a0," Hello! How are you doing tonight? I was waiting on here for about 2 hours earlier while I did some work but no one was on. No one is usually on here on Saturday nights. I'm assuming you didn't see the notification on your screen. Anyways, if unicorns were real that would be pretty cool.  I wonder if since their blood makes people live forever if we could create cures for illnesses with unicorn blood I'm curious your opinion on the new schedule changes to General Conference. Specifically the 2 hour time change they announced. I think it will be very good!  Bigger focus on teaching in the home.  I'm really excited to see and read the new curriculum they have planned for us to practice in our homes. They have been getting so good with their new curriculums.  Should be really exciting! I don't mean to blow up your chat, but need to get points somehow! I'm curious as to how the scoring is going to go for this coming round. They made it seem like they would send out an email fairly quickly, but they never did. I'm really hoping that they will make the top scorer of each round win the Ipad Pro's, because if they do then eventually I should win. Because you can't win more than one ipad so as long as you place like top 3 each round it'll guarentee you an ipad in at least one round. I don't know how those top two people did it last round though, because they scored like 3 million.  And by the end of the round no one was even participating so it was ... ... practically impossible to keep up. I'm guessing they are both freshmen who had a ton of time on their hands to just rack up tons of points My advice, just chat as much as possible this first week while people are active during this round before it starts to die down.  Because once it does, you won't be able to... ... rack up points quickly at all. I spoke with this one person yesterday who was typing what seemed to be like 200 words per minute. Just blowing through conversation topics left and right. I'm not sure what major you are, but I'm in the CS major and am thinking of joining a professors research study.  If you know of any good ones I'd love to hear about it! I love conference weekend, but at the same time it can stink too because things you'd usually get done on Saturday you can't because you have to be home most of the day. I spoke with someone else yesterday who had a funny name for talking to yourself on Chit Chat, he called it, ""Talking to the void"".  After doing it for over ten minutes it... ... really does feel like you're just talking to the void. I am currently updating my portfolio and have this one tiny feature that I'm trying to fix. So I have a hire me page where you can select certain items that you'd like me to do for you and you enter your name and email and it sends me an email. On my contact page though I have a button that just says, ""Email Me"" if you click it, it has an href tag that calls ""mailto:"" followed by my email. It's supposed to open up your default mailing source and have my email in the heading, but for some reason when I try to test it, it doesn't seem to work. I don't know if I've just got some weird setting on my computer, or on chrome, or if it just isn't working outright. I've been struggling to figure it out.  And when I look at examples of other people who have done it, it won't work for me still.  So I think it's got something to do with ... ... my computer I can't seem to figure out where in my settings I can change it though. The problem is on mac System Preferences there is nothing regarding mailing settings. And when I search about it online I just get information about fixing the problem on a windows machine.  Kind of frustrating. Anyways, I'm planning on just assuming it would work on someone else's device and pushing it to my byu domain file manager. Maybe I'll get on a computer at BYU that runs on Linux and see if it works then. Dang, about 20 minutes now talking to the void.  Pretty exhilarating stuff. Are you a bot? I think that what I would really like to see is an AI that uses communication signals to determine how you are feeling based off of verbal cues and tone of voice. And to be able to respond accordingly to you to help stabilize your mood. That would be really cool if they could implement something like that into Alexa or Siri I know that ""Eve"" (the name of this project) is supposed to be some sort of communication AI software for Alexa, but I'm not really sure what the exact purpose is. As far as I know there are already many other projects much more sophisticated already in operation so I'm curious which specific niche of this market they are working on. I think they should also tell us what kinds of conversations they would like us to have so that we can change our conversations to give them the most reliable information possible. Alrighty, well I'm going to head out.  I might just cue up another chat and wait for the next person to get on.  Good night void!",,

Because if so, that would make it more dull I think But if I could truly re experience the day as I did the first time that would make sense I think about that with music a lot For me at least, music experience depends a lot on what I feel like coming into the song And it's REALLY easy for my to overlisten to a song OR an album So I have to make sure I'm giving my music a constant cycle through Or it's the same with movies I remember the first time I saw inception I love it so much I bought it ANd then proceeded to watch it 6 times straight in the next few weeks And for a while after that I was frankly a little tired of inception And I still haven't whatched it since then But I love it and I hope I didn't burn myself out of it Anyways. Interesting thoughts on experience and reliving experiences I wonder if it's even a guarantee that you'd experience something the same if you relived it What if you went back and relived your favorite day of your life And then it was not as good as it was the first time THat would be a real downer And I mean, not like you go back and it turns out differently the second time than it did the first But you go back and everything happens EXACTLY as it did at first But you don't enjoy it as much For whatever reason MAybe your mental state isn't as good Or maybe your soul isn't as happy Who knows Just a thought Ok, you are clearly not hrere here So I'm gonna go Bye!",,

But the craziest thing I think I've ever done is...still undecided. It's hard to choose the craziest thing.

And the chorizo mix inside also has pig tail, pig ribs and pig tongue sometimes. It's actually really good. But the crazier thing is that I cooked it myself without actually knowing how to cook it.

I've had to talk to myself 5 of the past 6 conversations over the past 12 hours or so 8 hours or so actually I was asleep at 4 this morning Well that's not entirely true.  My dog woke me up needing to use the bathroom. Well... i'm guessing i'm just talking to myself. I'm currently watching friends on Netflix just waiting to start studying for my test tomorrow I've got like 2 tests this week and a project due on Friday too I'm probably going to go here in like 5 minutes honestly I just finished talking with potato (that's their screen name) for like an hour or so and am pretty beat. Potato likes to talk haha I got back from the vet with my little puppy about 2 hours ago.  We went in this morning to get here stitches removed from where they cut off her little back leg nubs, but they forgot to cut off a couple of them, so I had to go back this afternoon to get the rest of the stitches out. She was not a happy puppers. She knew exactly where we were going during the car ride so she just kept squirming the whole ride. She's just sleeping like sleeping beauty right now on my lap Crazy how tired dogs are all the time. Earlier today when I went on campus she somehow opened up her crate and started wandering around the house. I got back to a box of goldfish open and she had eaten like 15 goldfish or so. Such a pain to clean up haha She seemed very happy however.  I think she enjoyed running around eating goldfish while I was gone She made a little bit of a mess though which stinks because my parents are coming to town tomorrow which means I need to clean up.  But i also have a test tomorrow that I need to finish prepping for. I'll just do that later tonight I think I keep wanting to get off chit chat, but it's been so difficult to find people on here recently that I want to make sure I take advantage of the time while I can It's getting pretty difficult to keep up with some of the people on here that have a lot more time than me. I've also got an interview on Thursday to prep for, another test on Friday, and a project due on Friday.  Although I'm almost done with the project so that helps things. It's just going to be a long week probably I'm like trying to type fast, but my dog is like right on my lap so I can't really rest my arms down like I usually would while fast typing Makes it a little bit difficult Darn, I really wish there was someone participating in this conversation so that I wasn't just talking to myself. Responding to the prompt, I don't know what I would do if I had power for one day.  I would probably send a ton of aid and help to puerto rico to help with the terrible situation there But other than that i'm not sure what else could get accomplished with just one day politics being the way they are. Besides executive orders there really isn't a lot that can get done in just a day. Okay, well I'm getting pretty bored of just talking to myself. I'm going to go See you! Have a great day",,

1046,a92c2876-7dde-465e-be5a-cc480a5c59e0," What would I do if I had a magic wand? What an interesting question I think I would write a movie. Just because that's hard and the wand would make it way easier. This movie would be about America and the constitution. It would talk about the struggles of the constitution and the difficulty to get it approved by all the delegates and all the states. Especially New York. Because they were very stubborn. It would also talk about the taxes made on commerce by the British and the fights that the Americans have with the British. It would also have to talk about avoiding corruption and how to do it. Government needs to be something that manages a series of different situations. George Washington would be a huge key in this movie I would want to make. And it would have to include various patriots like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton and Madison It would also need to include the fact that the king of England is very stubborn and doesn't budge. Who thinks that the Americans are still not part of a new country but of his own. One that still continues to tax American goods. Also, it would talk about the need for the government of the Articles of Confederation to be changed because it just isn't going to work out. It would talk about the constitution being ratified so narrowly. And it would talk about the need for unity between the states and a powerful enough central government. There will be rebellion in many places and it would show that under the Articles of Confederation the central government wasn't able to fight back. And so they would gather together and revise the articles of Confederation. But they actually end up throwing it away and changing it completely. And they use the state constitutions and results as test cases or examples of how to form the new government Also, the only way a convention would happen is if George Washington would show up which he didn't feel like showing up because he didn't want to have anymore lime light. I think Washington was just being dramatic because he was very much like that. George Washington loved theatre and so I think he was acting. I'm sure he also was just really tired from everything that was going on Forming a new government after a revolution would be very hard And if Washington didn't show up to the convention of 1787 things wouldn't work out. But thankfully he did come. In the end he decided to. And we find out later that it is very important that they have this convention and that is was successful even though it was so close to being a failure.",I am gay This is news to me I didn't know Potatoes exist??

Its a beautiful spring day, the grass is green, the leaves are blooming, the air smells nice and sweet with the hints of nearby bakeries pumping out warm bread scented air You've been trying to exercise more lately, so as you put on your broght orange Nikes, the ones sloghtly worn from use, with small creases above the tow *toe You go over to the hook on the wall. Lots of various items hang from the hook, old and hardly used keys, lanyards, and you reach for a specific item and take it off Its a long red dog leash Fairly old, and looking like its been chewed up a fair amount As your hand lifts the leash from the cluttered hook, suddenly your thoughts are interuppted by an ecstatic golden retreiver bounding into the room You quicly clip on the leash to the dog's collar, and open your front door As you step outside you are greeted by the chill air, slowly getting warmer from the sluggish sun on the horizon You make sure to close and lock your door, and then head out, through the small, still asleep neoghborhood You go on a longer than usual walk, making sure to enjoy the silence and brisk air before it is gone for the day After nearly an entire hour of walking, you're nearly back to your house You notice a lot more people out and about now than when you left You make sure to wave to your three-house-down neoghbor Frank who is cutting his lawn. Frank smiles jovially and waves in return; he is always a happy man. As you get close to your house, you recognize someone coming from the opposit direction, you can tell its a girl, but you can't quite make out if you know her, however she Looks familiar, so you slow down a bit from your quick pace As you get closer, you recognize her It's your neighbor, Kinsley She's wearing a rather revealing outfit as she jogs, and your hesrt begins to beat faster As she gets closer, you smile and try your best to act casual. ""Should I finally ask her out"" you wonder, ""no, i can't do it"" As you near her, you steel yourself and decide to ask her out after all. You open your mouth to utter a casual greeting... Suddenly, before you can utter a word, a different voice cuts in. It's your dog, who has suddenly opened his mouth to utter a mere five words... ""Jack is a plane clapper"" Kinsley's face contorts into an expression of disgust and she quicly walks past you and hurries into her house You merely stand there, mouth hanging open in disbelief that your dog has once again ruined your chamce at a date.",I hope my dog never talks wow ,

But maybe it's more like putting them into a medically induced coma Because you could just turn them on again. And medically induced comas are recoverable, right? I guess I don't know a lot about them, just what I've seen in movies. Which is honestly probably not real. Oh well. They're still fun movies to watch! Like Captain America! Except he doesn't go into a medically induced coma. It's more like an ice-induced coma. So I don't know if that counts. Although, maybe cryo-sleep type things can count as medically induced comas?

There's a lot of cool architecture to see from earlier centuries. You have to go see it! So, have you ever been to Spain? Or at least I hope that it is getting better... Their economy isn't the greatest right now but it's getting better I think. Have you ever been to Spain? Most people here think it is a third world country but it's a super nice country. I'm wondering how I can make it possible. But it would be sooooooo cool! But, money is an object so all these dreams are pretty extreme. Also I would go to a barcalona verus Real Madrid game. Those get intense. I would have to do a huge tour of Spain because there is so much to do there. It sounds terrible but it is actually really really good. And go to Ponferrada to eat food typical of the Bierzo. Like botillo. It's a pig bladder stuffed with chorizo and pig tail and sometimes tongue. I would have to go to Galicia and eat octopus and caldo gallego. it's So its a little crazy They import all of it! How ridiculous! Because they also fish there. Also, do you know why the fish is super expensive on the Canary Islands?? Or you could say wicked awesome too. That would be really cool. I would probably go and stay in Tenerife. There are a lot of hippies that live on the beaches there but I wouldn't do that. I would live in a hotel or an apartment. And drink clipper everyday for weeks while staying on the beach. And gofio with honey and milk. Also, I would have to go the the Canary Islands and eat mojo and papas canarias those are all super good types of food. Fabada, cachopo, chorizo, paella, mariscos Oh! If I went to Spain I would eat all the Spanish food possible there. Also, what is your absolute favorite food? Maybe I hired them along the way on the trip. They would probably be really buff guys. Maybe even Russians Also, they would need to be well trained just because you don't want some crazy guy as your security guard. I might also need security guards for some of the more dangerous countries around the world And I would need to exercise a lot. Probably in all of the countries I'd be in, I would need a gym membership. Not just the plain pizzas but the really extravagant ones. And I would need to try all the types of food in Italy. Especially all the different types of pizza. I think chocolate mint is wicked good. Also, what is or favorite flavor of ice cream? Also, if you had all the money in the world, would you go on a trip around the world or would you do something else? So...what would you do? Where would you go? What would be the best part? Anything you would look forward to if you did a trip like the one that I described? Also I would probably want to take my brother or someone to have some company or else it would be very boring I think. Obviously the food is the best part. And I would need to do a lot of exercise so I dont get super fat. I would also have to go see different monuments and the typical touristy things. I want to stay in each country And it would not be a cheap trip because I would try all the foods of those cultures and countries. So this would probably take about 10 years to do depending on how long Those are all super cool countries. Then I could visit Nepal, Thailand, China and Japan. And then I could go visit Turkey and Bosnia and then head over to Asia. I think it would be cool to see France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece. You know. The typical ones. But if money were not an object, I would travel the world. Starting with going and visiting Europe. And then probably going to Asia. It's like every other prompt that I get. I have gotten this prompt half a billion times. If money were no object.. ",

Every wild pig would take to the sky Tusks raging It would be terrifying Especially because the pigs would be massive Because why not? They would be the size of buildings Just like in Percy Jackson book five If I do remember correctly The world would be in utter turmoil All mankind would be in mortal terror of the monsters Soon elephants would follow suit Behemoths with tusks the size of skyscrapers Outer space would be no obstacle They would fly all over the solar system Colonizing planets everywhere they went Jupiter would be their base because it is biggest It would be the Texas of the solar system For obvious reasons Every animal on Earth would eventually grow wings Flying great white sharks would make sharknado a reality Flying blue whales would scoop up huge flocks of pigeons Instead of krill Which would also fly in the air and feed on bugs So bats would be out of a job Deep sea creatures would eventually migrate to Venus Where they could withstand the high pressures Birds would no longer feel special for having wings So they would feel sad But they would eventually come to accept the new order of things Komodo dragons would grow wings as well And there really would be flying dragons Now wouldn't that be something I would get myself a flying panda Whom I would name Murphy And together we would travel the world wherever we wished We could visit his cousins in China And visit mount kilimanjaro Without having to hike to the top manually People all over the world would travel via flying animals Planes would become much less popular Horses would once again become popular modes of travl But planes would still be fastest So they would still be used, of course Just not as much as they are nowadays People in Africa would get flying giraffes and lions So everybody would be jealous of them Anything would be possible The OASIS would be a real thing Except the world would be awesome Not a dystopia, because that would be no good Wizards would be needed to protect everyone from these flying creatures So Harry Potter would be real The mascot of Hogwarts would be a flying hog Now, what else would be possible? A bridge would be built from New York to England It would be like the bridge from China to Hong Kong Except way bigger, obviously... And all countries would just get along with each other So big projects like that could be done A colony would get started on the moon! If pigs could fly, then why not that? The James Webb telescope would be launched And we could image extrasolar planets and such And do some terraforming on Mars Put some oceans back there But back to the pigs...

The Canadian people are super cool. And they speak English and French. How wicked awesome is that?! By the way, have you ever eaten lobster? It's the best food in the world. It's sooo good with butter. I guess there are other great foods but lobster is definitely up there. Also, have you eaten salmon? I'm sure you have. Smoked salmon is an acquired taste but I also think that it is a good tasting food. What's your favorite food? Mine is probably pizza. Pizza is so good. I love Hawaiian pizza. Have you ever eaten Hawaiian pizza? Also pepperoni is a good second. Meat lovers is also wicked awesome. Also I love hotdogs. They are great Have you ever had hotdogs? I don't know what else to eat sometimes. They are so easy to cook. Have you ever had a chili dog? Those are also very good. Have you ever had waffles? Those are also very great.

1441,46579050-d289-4d15-8304-f13b55c76214," That's a good question! A question that I'm actually not quite sure how to answer I'm not closely familiar with any particular charities I think humanitarian work in 3rd world countries is great Helping people with better nutrition, clean water, education, etc. There are many organizations that engage in undertakings like that It's probably bad that I'm having this much trouble thinking of any by name Of course, I know the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints does a lot of work like that I also think helping people who have lost their homes to natural disasters is a great cause There have been lots of natural disasters in the United States recently I mean, there have been lots of natural disasters EVERYWHERE, for that matter... And everyone ought to be helped I would also support charitable organizations that help couples adopt children Adoption agencies? Those are important Less important, but still important, are animal care centers and rescue shelters that help get animals to good homes Now what else is there.... I can't think of any that don't involve helping unfortunate people or lost animals But I suppose that's what philanthropy is all about I think I may have donated to a hospital once You know, I left some coins in a jar at some place one time When it come to being ""passionate"" about a particular one, I'm afraid I don't have a clear answer And the question says MOST passionate.... Like I'm supposed to be passionate about multiple causes I'm a terrible human being Just kidding I don't think that I just think I need to get more involved with that charitable and philanthropic stuff I wonder what the best way to go about that would be I guess I could just Google it and look up ""philanthropic causes"" And stuff like that Philanthropy always reminds me of Studio C The old episode sketch they did with the Facebook Philanthropist Who ""liked"" worthy causes That was good stuff I could get behind that cause Although I don't use Facebook very much So I would probably be no good at that philanthropic cause either Woe is me The terrible human Who isn't involved in charity The end!!!!!!",,

Meat, surface area - in short, a thing that takes up space. Too much space within this cruelly straitened rectangle. It has no other baggage. It does not come to us invested with symbolism at all. It does not trumpet itself. If it were invited to bellow, it might well bleat. It is stripped bare of nearly all that old-time cowish stuff. And why not laugh at a cow anyway?

Anyways, I just got finished taking both my quiz and test for my Bio class. Brutal stuff.  I am a CS major and honestly just don't care about biology.  But, that's no excuse for not acing the class. I did somewhat decent.  With the extra credit we can get I should have a nice grade in that class. To answer the prompt, I would probably be really sad.  Probably would go do lots of fun things for a little bit.  Drive to Disneyland and ride some rides.  And then since I can't fly a plane I would probably attempt to do that Ultimately crashing an no longer being by myself :) purely an accident of course due to my terrible flying. Then I wouldn't have to worry about being alone anymore. I'm really curious as to if people with serious depression see things in that light.  That's really sad.. I think that's why it's so tough for them to function. I've been reading up a lot on depression recently.  Very interesting topic and I know quite a few people struggling with it. On a brighter note:  my parents flew into town last night, a day earlier than I was expecting.  So I get to go out to lunch with my mom today. Should be a lot of fun! Random thought, one of my favorite things to do is casually stroll through the Talmage and just look at the freshmen stressing out over projects they're struggling with. And then proceed to help out if needed :) I really enjoy helping out with classes i've already taken, partly because it's so much easier to do having done like 3 levels of courses above that which they're studying, but it's also fun teaching people to program. I think that if all else fails, I wouldn't mind being a professor one day.  Granted, I'd probably have to get like a masters or PhD.  But still would be fun. I think maybe if I can just be super successful in my field then they would be willing to let me teach without multiple degrees and stuff. Okay, well I have to go.

I was in Russia, in a city near St. Petersburg, and I was looking for my friend, because we got separated when I got off the bus a stop earlier than he was expecting. As I was walking towards where the next bus stop was, I saw an another friend, an Armenian, who was standing on the street with one of his buddies. I said, ""Hey, how's it going?"" And he introduced me to his friend. We had a good chat, then all of a sudden we were surrounded by about 10 more Armenian guys, sporting leather jackets and gold chains and so on. They were all really confused to see me in the middle of their meeting. My friend (the Armenian) told me I should probably go, so they could discuss some important business. And that's how I ended up in the middle of a meeting of the Armenian mob in that city. Right as I was walking away, my friend (the American one) turned the corner. He said he was really worried about what would happen to me. But he was glad that I made it out alright. I was glad for that, too. Especially because these guys were scary.

One day there was a girl whose hair had the power to heal the sick.  A wicked witch found out about this little girl's ability and kidknapped her. The witch locked the girl in a tower that had no doors nor stairs. After many years, the girl's hair grew and grew until it was long enough for a person to climb to the top of the tower using it as a ladder. When her hair had reached that length, a handsome prince happened to be riding his horse nearby. Now, the little girl had been practicing her singing since she didn't have much to do up in her tower and had a beautiful voice. While the prince was riding near the tower, he could hear the what he thought was the voice of an angel.  Upon hearing such a voice, he could not help but sing along. Unfortunately, the young prince did not have the time to practice singing nor had anyone told him that his void was horrid, so when the girl heard what sounded like a dying bird, she peered out the window. She gasped when she saw the prince for she had never seen a man before.  She called out to him asking what that noise was. ""It was my singing,"" he replied. ""That is no singing!"" She yelled back.  ""Here, come up to my tower and I will teach you how to sing.""  So she let down her hair and beckoned him to climb to the top. The prince made it to the top of the tower and they began his voice lessons.  It was not long, however, when the wicked witch returned.  ""Let down your hair!"" She yelled up to the girl. With another gasp, the girl said, ""Coming!"" ""Quick, hide!"" she told the prince, for the witch would not allow for strangers to be in her tower. With the prince hidden, she let down her hair and allowed the witch to enter.  ""Hmm, you seem odd today, girl."" The witch said as she entered the window, ""almost, happy.  I don't like it, I don't like it one bit!  You have someone here with you, don't you?!"" The prince yelped in surprise of the witches knowledge of him.  The witch heard the yelp and uncovered the prince, who was hiding under the bed. Thinking quickly the girl yelled to the prince ""Sing!"" The prince started to sing with his cringe worthy voice, ""Lalalala!"" The witch cringed and stumbled back by sheer all the way until she fell out the window. ""Oh no!"" the two gasped together. ""I hope she is okay!"" said the prince. ""She landed on some bushed, she's knocked out but she'll be fine,"" responded the girl as she peered out the window again. ""Well then, I should get going then,"" said the prince. ""Can I come with you!"" said the girl. ""Sure, but how are we going to get out of this tower?"" Asked the prince. They put their heads together and formulated a plan.  Using their combined smarts, they cut the girl's hair and wove it into a ladder.  Now they both could escape and make it on their way. When the witch woke up she was furious but then noticed the ladder made of hair.  ""The magic that girl possessed resided in that hair.  Hmm, I wonder why I didn't just cut it in the first place and keep all the hair to my self.  I'll let them go then and live here with the magic hair."" She said. The prince and the girl rode off together in the sunset.  ""I never got your name fair maiden,"" the prince asked. ""Repunzel"" she responded. ""Wow!"" He gasped, ""You're the long lost princess!  You're my sister!""",,

I think we could unequivocally denounce the termination of such an individual as murder, but if the message is simply implying that the computer has reached intelligence levels that rival or surpass that of the average human, I would say that it is not only morally justifiable, but our responsibility as a member of the human race to turn off the power to ensure the future prosperity of our people.

Really good stuff hmm okay I'm just going to practice my typing then And during hte few moments that we have left, we want ot have just an off the ocuff chat betwene you and me -- us. We want to talk right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand. We all agree tonight, all of the speakers have agreed, that america has a very serious problem. Not only does American have a very serious problem, but our people have a very serious problem, American problem is us. We're her problem. The only reason she has a problem is she doesn't want us here. And every time you look at yourself, be you black, borwn, red or yellow -- a so called Negro -- you represent a person who poses such a serious problem for America you're not wanted. Once you face this a fact, then you can start plotting a course that will make you appear intelligent, instead of unintelligent. What you and I need to do is learn to forget our differences. When we come together, we don't come together as Baptists or Methodists. You don't catch hell  cause you're a Baptist, and you don't catch hell cause you're a Methodist. You don't catch hell cause you're a Methodist or Baptis. you don't catch hell because you're a Democrat or a Republican. You don't catch hell because you're a Mason or an Elk. And you sure don don't catch hell cause you're an American. cause if you was an American, you woudln't cath no hell/ You catch hell cause you're black man. You catch hell, all of us catch hell, for the same reason. So we are all black people, so called, second-class citizens, ex slaves. You are nothing but a ex slave. You don't like to be Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the AMerican people and to address their concerns, their hope and their optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission, to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieve extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could have never imagined we have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul and the steel in America's spine. Each test forged new American heroes ot remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas Strip. We hear tales of Americans, like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery , with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters int eh scene used for Hurrican Harvey. 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee barved power lines -- downed power lines and deep water to save 40 lives. Ashlee , we all thank you . Thank you ver much. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped in a California summer camp, threatened by those devastating wildfires. to everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, everywhere, we are with you , we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very muc much, David. Great job. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house, a guy and was back to work three and ahalf months later. The legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic of the capitol police police officers, the Alexandria police and the doctors, nurses and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others and some in this room -- of many others, some in this room. In the aftermath of that terible shooitng we came together, not as Republicans or Democratics, but as representatives of the people. But it is is not enough to come together only in times of. Tragedy. Tonigh, I call on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are teh people we are elected. to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always know. That no people on are so fearless or daring or determined as Ammericans. if there is a mountian, we climb it. if there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. Let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong, because our people are strong. And together we are building a safe, strong, and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 Million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in mmanufacturing alone. T Tremendous. After years and years of wages stagnation.  we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45 year low. And something I am very proud of: African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in hisotyr. Small business confidence is at an all time high. The stock market has smashed one record after anohter, gaining a trillion dollars and more in value in just this short period of time. the great news for Americans: 401k retirement, pension, and college savings accoutns have gone through th the roof. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted teh biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business to lower tax rates for hard working Americnas. We nearly doubled the standard deducation for everyone. Now, the first earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making will see their tax bill reduced by 200 slashing their tax bill in half. In April this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system. And millions of Americans will h have more take home pay, starting next month. A lot more We eliminated an especially and especially cruel tax on Americans making less than a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalities, simply because they could not afford gove government ordered health plans. We reprealed the cored of the disastrous obamacare, the individual mandate is now gone Thank you We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 20 to 21 percent. So american companies can compete against anyone, anywhere else in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than a lot of money small business have also received a massive tav cut, and now can deduct 20 percent of their buissnes income. Here tonight are steve staub and sandly keplinger of staub",,

I liked Boston We almost stumbled across American history everyday We were able to go to the Boston pops firework show too. It was very American We also went up to Maine and then down to Connecticut for two separate weekends Both were really neat It's amazing how the east coast can be so diverse The lighthouses in Maine were so old and very picturesque against the rocky New England coast line I kind of wish we had lobster out there My wife really isn't into sea food but she said that she would try it out there because it was so fresh it was just so expensive And overall, we had no regrets We also learned a lot about how to deal with a lot of rain. It would pour somedays and we had to figure out how to still get to work, be outside in the rain Have you ever been to Boston? We also did some hikes while we were out there Since my wife and I had been living in Utah for the past couple of years we missed having good mountainy hikes And rocks in general Kind of weird huh? We found some good hike though They definately weren't like any up American Fork Canyon but there were goood At the top they had to build a little stand so you could see up over everything So it wasn;t much of a mountain but it was still good So am I supposed to just talk to myself on this thing?

One of the best feelings ever in the world is leaving work to go home. I love that feeling because I worked my shift and now it's time to go home and it's just a very nice feeling to have. Do you understand the feeling that I am emulating? Does your mind comprehend the complexity of the situation  and the gravity of the malevolence of bosses? According to the National Geographic Weather, the estimation of their predictable circumstances have generated a theory that Utah weather is more inclined to be cold. The inclination of this cold weather is owed to the fact that Utah is just a cold state in the winter and winter is the season we are approaching. I am really hungry by the way. I have hardly eaten anything all day and now my stomach is just growling with pain. It's not a very good idea to not eat that much. I didn't eat breakfast, lunch, and I am going home to eat dinner which makes coming home especially nice. You don't seem to be replying to me. Are you there or are you away from the keyboard? Why is it that you are not replying to me? This is supposed to be a two way conversation. If not, I am going to get bored, and I will not have anybody to talk to, so if you could please talk to me, I would very much appreciate it. Can you please talk to me please? I am still waiting for you to reply to me. If you find me annoying, you can just end the chat. I understand if you don't want to talk with me. I mean, I wouldn't really understand because you haven't met me and I haven't met you. There shouldn't be any reason as to why you don't want to talk to me.

Anyway the most interesting thing I've learned recently is that if you intervene too much in your kids life, like if they are fighting with a sibling and you immediately break it up without letting them have a disagreement then they will never learn how to properly resolve conflicts. They wont learn the necessary communication skills to hear the other persons point of view while also supporting their own in a mutually respectful way. Which can lead to problems later on when they are married or in more serious relationships where disagreements can happen and often do.",,

I can easily explain the logic and process of all the problems I will probably get, but I won't be able to write them up perfectly I'm predicting Should I use a language that's closely related that I know how to code up perfectly to solve their questions, or should I use one of their preferred languages and probably... ...screw up a lot of the syntax?

I'm studying psychology and am currently learning about the way the brain works, especially in the sense of emotions ... as far as I can tell, emotions are a very complex, and sometimes even humans have a hard time expressing or explaining or even identifying their emotions. If it is possible to hardwire a computer to feel or experience such complex emotions, and if they are able to accurately identify them, then I'd say it would be possible But I feel as though we have a long ways to go in the world of technology until it comes to the point where computers can fall in love","I just think about the movie, Artificial Intelligence when I think about whether computers can love. But true, like what you said, emotions are complex in general and have a lot of different factors/affectors that are hard to predict I mean in terms of a brain working, it's off of nerves firing electric pulses right? So if there's a way to copy the way neurons work, then maybe they can accomplish that? ",

YOu probably aren't but I've done this a lot of times before I just love talking to myself lol its the best its fantastic 10 points if you can name the movie where its from I can wait Oh yeah, it's from nacho libre that s one of my favorite movies do you have afavorite movie? If so what is it? Where was it made? When was it made? HOw was it made? Who was it made? Why was it made? tellll meeee I want to know everything there is to know about this movie here I don't know that much about nacho libre so I cant tell you much about it I also love emporers new groove, napolean dynamite, jumanji, i got a bunch of movies that  Ireally like disney movies are pretty good too wbu? huh I haven't heard anything interesting from you allday!!! tell mee! I'm on the edge of my seat waiting to hear a response from you ohhh nameless one!! What should I call you then??? Oh great one I guess I won't call you anything because you arent' answering me and I guess that is just fine if you dont wanna name you wont get a name I'll jsut sit here waiting  for a resposne you see this is me waiting for a response I want a response haha I hope if htere is someone on this actually that I am not being that desperate, idk this is just a little entertaining for me maybe a little bit for you too lololo anyways thsi has been great talking to you I'm not leaving just yet tho You're not getting rid of me that easily I'll just type random things here I like rock n roll I like talking to new people as well I might be going on a mission in a year or too.  I want to go on a performing mission in nauvoo would be cool I really like performing and it sounds like a lot of fun there I'm not sure how good I would be a ta regular mission I'll definitely try my best if i do go It just depends whats the right thing for me to d o But here is a super long message about how I want to win this competition because  i ahve a virus on my computer and cant afford a new one I want to at least try for this super hard because my dad recieved a pay cut and can't pay for a lot of my schooling i want to pay for as much as I can but no one would hire me and when they did they treated me kind of horribly I've also applied for a bunch of scholarships but to no avail unfortunately It's really sad because I've worked so hard but it hasnt worked out so well so i really want to try really hard at this and maybe  Iwont have to pay for a new computer But then again  Iam going against 1000's of other kids that have the same goal some might need it even more than me but i really want to try so i can have one part of my college life payed for I am honestly just praying I can reach the top and recieve this laptop it would honestly be a prayer answerred and here i am ranting to someone who isn't even listening and then there is that guy that has a whole whopping 9 million points will i get disqualified if i copy and paste stuff? I am pretty high up hto, it's better than 1000 place right?? I will at least get a box of chocolates which will be better than recieving nothing so I'll just try my best to get that maybe looks like you cant copy and paste I wasn't going to do a whole lot of it, maybe just a few times but how long has this contest been open??? How long has number 0 guy been working at getting these points, he must have been doing this for a long time or  it could be a she too, I feel bad that I automatically assume that it is a boy It seems more like boy initials idk maybe its girl initials I'm also wondering if i have talked to this person and if  I liked talking to them who knows maybe you're the mystery person and you are just reading this do you get points if you don't say anything andthe other person is the only person talking?? Idk because I'm sure if someone doesn't respond in ten minutes then they leave the chat then some people dont know that they ended the chat and they keep talking to themselves but I mean  I'm getting points forit so that s nice I wonder if anyone else is doing this as well I mean its pretty smart You dont have to wait for any responses you just get to type like you are having a 2 sided conversation with yourself almost I think its a pretty good idea but what if it doesn't count towards the prizes that would really stink but then I am kind of still providing information for this eve bot btw I'm sure she's going to be awesom I wonder if this is going to be a real thing or if they are just doing this for ideas if it will actually be up and running someday and like how much will they cost I hope they don't eavesdrop like alexa, that would be interesting I would not like that very much I mean who honestly likes being eavesdropped on tho everyone that does raise your hand so I can take a count Oh wow, the majority votes that they don't like it very much with one vote MEEEE Wow, we think so much alike Morghan!! Too bad you can't put out your instagram then we can always talk and be best friends forever!! Oh wait.  I'm talking to myself :( No wonder I have no friends lol jkskskjjkjk I have friends, I'm just pretending to be a doofus Don't take me seriously guys please I hope that I am just racking up the points here I really would like to get as many points as i can There was one person that only had like one chat but it had like 400 thousand points It was pretty cool i wonder if they are doing this to get their points you dont have to wait for other people to reply because sometimes it takes a long time for them to reply i also wonder if any of my friends are doing this they probably arent as hardcore as me lol I'm in this for the win and i think I am doing pretty good so far I'm not sure tho I have got a long way to go How far is a good way to go?? Should I go all out in this and do this only for the next few days or should i not do this I am almost done with finals so thats really good i guess I need to keep checking my points and see if i am going up very slowly maybe i should talk to an actual person that sounds like a good idea maybe I will try a real person chat just for fun I'll also keep this one because you know this morghan fellow seems pretty cool How's eve doing today?? Has she been created yet? Has she had a good day? EEEEeeEEEEeeEEeEeEvvvve walleEeeeEEEeeeEEeeeeEEE aaaa a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a That seemed to give me afew points but not a whole lot i guess",,

I'm not sure if you've read Enders Game and specifically the book in that series called Speaker for the Dead, but I'm curious if traveling that fast would have an effect on time Like, if I left the earth and travelled for what I perceived as a year at faster than light speeds, I wonder if when i got back if it would be like 14 years in the future or n not What I am super curious about and interested in is establishing colonies on other planets.

I would want to motivate people to work towards something worthwhile rather than just sit and take handouts all day. I would maybe write a book or become a public speaker to accomplish this.

2335,bc8a2b52-6012-41bc-8ee8-333063a884ef," Impossible. There is no way that a computer could fall in love with another computer. I think in order for that to happen they would need to have a soul or something and they don't have one of those so nope. Plus thats kind of weird. I mean with movies like Wall-E I guess those guys count as computers so techinically if you think about it they could fall in love. I guess in my mind when I read the prompt I was thinking more about like two computer computers. Like if I left my laptop open and put it in front of another laptop it probably wouldn't fall in love. I wonder what actual computers think about this if they can actually think? Anyways, let me tell you what I did today. I woke up at 7:30 ate some food and went to the crossfit gym! There i got together with some of my buddies and we did a fun little Workout. Its called the monster mash, no idea why. Probably because its a monster of a workout, it took me about 35 minutes to finish and took a lot of the other guys less. I was kind of one of the slow ones. Most have them have been doing crossfit for a couple years now. I guess I could be considered a novice since I just started this year. I do however, learn pretty quickly so I think next time with a little more practice and some good nutrition I'll be able to either keep up or beat them at the workout! After that I came home and my neighbor texted me they were helping one of out other neighber lay some beauty bark in his front lawn so I went over and helped out with that. That was pretty fun got to hangout with some buddies, shovel some bark and clean up some blown over twigs and dirt and trees! We had a good time. After that I came home took a shower and spent some time with my wife. She made enchiladas for dinner last night so we had left overs for breakfast and they tasted really good Anyways thanks for chatting sorry i talked whole bunch! Maybe next timeyou can do the talking! haah",,

Or really any time I want to move the computer. So that's really annoying. But you know, it's okay. At least I have a computer! It's pretty useful for everything. It even has decent graphics, so I can play some good games on it. I used to play a ton of Skyrim. That was an extremely addicting game. But extremely fun, too! I guess that's what makes it addicting. Also the gameplay made it addicting, though. I would play and play and new missions would come up as I completed them. And each new mission only seemed like it would take me a few more minutes. But pretty soon, twenty or thirty of these missions would pile up! And then BAM, it's three or four in the morning and I have class in five hours. Haha, it was pretty rough. But fun. But still, I'm really glad I'm married! It makes my life a lot better at least because I Oops. *Get the right amount of sleep that I'm supposed to get.",,

I usually just watch youtube videos to learn new things. School is for suckers. Plus youtube is free. There is actually a real problem with the school systems nowadays. Allow me to explain. You pay all this money to get a degree that is supposed to help you get a better job. But nationwide, over 65% of college grads end up in jobs that they could have gotten without a degree. So they are in debt and working a job that they didn't need to be in debt for. Is this considered cheating? Like If I just type and no one answers are you going to disqualify me? I mean you let me start the chat, and I have no control over what anyone else does. So I'm just trying to help you get as much data as possible. And like, no one has reach out to me to stop it so I'm just assuming it's ok. But if there is something wrong with this. Please, let me know. I want to win. But I want to win fair and square, playing by the rules. Just know that I really am doing my best to help you guys out by providing the most chat data possible. And that if I accidentally  do something that is no okay I apologize. But you probably do want people to actually chat, so I'm going to end this chat and then start a new one and hopefully find some people. Or i'll just invite my friends on here Thanks for doing this!

Everything I learn in that class is super interesting Yesterday we learned about the Jovian planets, which are the gas giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune I guess I may as well explain what I've learned... Jupiter is 2.5 times more massive than every other planet and moon  in the solar system combined The layered appearance of Jupiter is a result of different zones of the planet spinning at different rates There are many storms that form on it's surface, but they all fade relatively quickly The one exception to that is the great red spot A storm so big that 3 Earths could fit inside it The pressure within Jupiter is so great that its hydrogen  is placed in a ""liquid metallic"" state Which, in turn, generates a huge magnetic field that causes auroras at the poles, just like on Earth It also has a ring, but it is faint and rocky so it doesn't reflect much light Unlike Saturn's ring, which is mostly made out of ice Saturn is very similar to Jupiter, and has some very interesting features such as a crazy vortex  at the south pole And a hexagonal cloud pattern at the north pole, the like of which have never been seen before Well, it seems that no one else will be joining this chat So I will now instigate a fictional conversation between Alan and Albert: Alan: hey man, how's it going? Albert: pretty well, how about you? Alan: oh, you know. Same old stuff. These goats won't feed themselves! Albert: you spend all your time with those goats! Alan: yeah...but it's not like I have anything better to do Albert: fair enough. You do you, man. (At this point in the conversation, Amy pipes in) Amy: hey guys! What's all this I hear about goats? I love those cute things! Albert: uhhh who are you? Do I know you? Amy: nope! Albert: ok, I guess. Whatever. Amy: why do you have to take care of goats? How many do you have? Alan: it's basically just a hobby. I herd this flock of ten thousand sheep all over the mountainside Amy: whoa, here in Utah? Alan: oh no, certainly not. I live in Nepal. Amy: ohhhhh that makes more sense. I had a hard time picturing so many sheep here in Provo Albert: he ranches the sheep. That means he feeds them with ranch dressing and plays country music for them. Amy: (in admiration) wow! Amy: do you have a favorite sheep with so many? Alan: it's hard to pick an absolute ""favorite, per se, but I am quite fond of Abed-nedago lll (Now, another stranger joins the conversation - none other than Richard himself) Richard: HELLO FRIENDS THIS IS RICHARD HOW ARE YOU GUYS TODAY Albert: oh, uh, hey, we're doing fine thank you... Richard: I HEARD YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT RANCH DRESSING Amy: yeah, Alan was saying that he feeds it to his sheep. And also, you don't need to type in all caps haha Richard: oh yeah, haha, sorry about that. Old habit. Anyways, any of y'all want to talk about volcanoes? Alan: actually, they were goats, not sheep Amy.... Amy: oops Alan: what do you like about volcanoes, Richard? Richard: oh, you know...the whole KABOOM and then lava  and smoke clouds that go halfway around the world. They're pretty impressive Albert: I'd give that a score of fifty for sure! Ash clouds all the way, I say! Alan: as long as they lava doesn't go straight through my front yard, I don't really have any problems with it. I do like the color. Richard: speaking of colors, do all of you have a favorite color? Alan: of course! Being a goat-herd, I am quite partial to the color of cumulonimbus clouds ready to drop rain so my goats will have plenty to drink A Albert: I really like the color of vegetable oil after three or four or even fifty four batches of chicken have been fried in it Amy: that sounds simply delightful, Albert. I really like the color brown too Amy: though I'm a bit more partial to the color of gravy, myself. Especially with chunks in it. Richard: coo coo, my friends, that's awesome. Say, have any of you seen the new movie Incredibles ll yet? Alan: sorry, I haven't. I don't see many shows here in the frigid Nepalese mountains Richard: I see how it is. You leave me no choice but to declare....an ADJECTIVE BATTLE!!!! Alan: AAAAHHHHH not again! I always lose these things! Albert & Amy: (in unison) you can do it, Alan! You're the man! If you can't do it, no one can! Alan: ok friends, I will give it my all! This is for my sixty-first goat, Sir Henry Abdul Nokota lV!!!! Richard: planty the potted plant gracefully sails on a thin rope through the airy air to smash into the supervillain's evil contraption! Alan: Henry the fearless billygoat quickly leaps over a steep cliff! Richard: well played. Jerusha the alligator scrambled out of the wet billabong to snap at a tasty burger left in the road! Albert: ooh, this is getting good! These guys are pros! Alan: thanks Albert! Here's my next one: flighty the veracious groundhog burst out of the cold ground with a spring in his hop and a leap in his quick step! Richard: ok, you win this round! But I'll be back! MWAHAHA..... (Richard vanishes from the conversation, anf from the memories of those engaged in it) Amy: what just happened? I feel so disoriented, like things were happening while I was asleep Albert: same! One moment I was at home in my living room, and now I'm on a pirate ship about to walk the plank! Who knew? Alan: whatever it was, it seems to have finally passed us by. Thankfully, all my goats are still accounted for. Amy: you still have all seventy two of the purple piebald goats? It would be a shame to lose any of those ones. Alan: I'm not sure how you knew about those ones, but yep, I've still got 'em! Albert: I'm not sure how to break this to you guys, but...I'm actually French... Amy: that's ok,  buddy. We've known for a loooong time now. Albert: how can that be? I just met you in the past hour! Amy: or did you? Are you quite sure of that, Albert Frances Morrel Xll? Albert: oh no! It can't be! MOM?????? Amy: *wink* (Albert leaves the conversation speedily.  No further communications with  him are made during the chat) Alan: well, I guess it's just you and me now, Amy. Just as it should be. Amy: haha, can you believe that I pulled that off? Convincing Albert I was his mother? Alan: that was pretty impressive! How did you know his full name? Amy: oh, just my good friend Google. I know EVERYBODY'S full name. Alan: even mine? Even though I'm from Nepal and not Asia minor? Amy: obviously, Al. You only have one name! How could I forgot? Alan: oh yeah, very true... Amy: I've only met eighty eight people in my life who only had one name, and not two or more. You should be proud! Amy: also, I, um, don't know how to say this, but I'm from Nepal too... Alan: WHAT? Why didn't you mention this earlier? I get so lonely sometimes by myself! Alan: I would love to meet you sometime, we could go out for some Kefir or something! Amy: I'm afraid I can't do that, Alan. Alan: wait...a subtle 2001 Space Odyssey reference.... Amy: we actually know each other quite well. Better than you think we do, I daresay. Alan: something is real fishy about this  whole thing,  but I can't quite place it yet... Amy: if you don't get this within 96 seconds, Imma eat ALL this ranch dressing by myself! Alan: (after a long pause) you're name isn't Amy, is it. Abed-Nedago ll: nope! And could you please change the tunes? We've been listening to Carrie Underwood all day! Alan: Abed! What have I told you about playing with phones!!! Alan: go run along and play with Albert and Richard! Abed, Albert, and Richard: (in unison) BAAAAAAA!!!!! Alan: man, I get so bored up here. I must be going crazy with just these goats to talk to....",,

I feel that with social media and everything that it portrays, humanity is losing sight of what real beauty is. I think a lot of mental health problems could be solved if peop Began to accept each other for who they truly are. People would also live healthier lives because they wouldn't feel like they have to pretend to be someone they are not.","I think I could get on board with your cause. People need to let go of what other people think and just love themselves as much as they love others. People just need to realize that they literally cannot pretend. They are who they are, and pretending doesn't change that. ",

2475,dc15a616-163d-49ee-8f5a-572aeff095bf," If I were in power for a day I would do some pretty wicked awesome stuff. I would start by annexing Canada because that is necessary to decrease our national debt. Trump is doing well but would be doing a lot better if he just annexed Canada. Russia would be cooler to annex but they would put up a lot bigger fight. Also, it wouldn't take much. How many people really live in Canada? They would make great US citizens. They speak English and French! How cool is that! We could also trade a lot easier with them and get a bunch of maple syrup down to the south. We would also have an increase of the amount of pancakes and waffles eaten. And probably scrambled eggs too because you have to have scrambled eggs with pancakes and waffles. Maybe sausage too. It just depends on the day. Especially if one eats a lot of fatty foods, sausage isn't good for you. I wonder what would happen first if someone ate too many sausages... Dying from a heart attack or from the boredom of eating the same thing over and over without getting proper nutrition. Maybe they could get to a hospital or something and have their veins enlarged so that they don't have a heart attack. Being honest, I have no clue what causes a heart attack. But I can pretend I know about it. Also, what is the most unhealthy food you have ever eaten? I think for me it is salad. It's just so gross you know? You know what else is gross? Never mind. Have you ever been so tired that you just fall asleep in class? Like you are listening but you zone out and then your eyes start to close? That was happening to me today in computer programming. It's so complicated and sometimes the details just so confusing that I automatically fall asleep. I try to follow it but it doesn't work for long. I lose it after about 30-40 minutes. It's just so hard to stay awake!! But when actually programming you have to pay attention to the details. It can be super stressful too when timed and your code isn't working correctly. That happened to me on the first midterm. I was pressed on time and stressed out . I got super nervous and things didn't work out. But in the end I guess things work out because as long as I get a higher grade on my final they will raise my midterm grade. So that is super comforting for me. So hopefully I can get a better grade on my final than I did on that first midterm. It takes about three hours for a midterm in computer science. Not an enjoyable three hours. That's for sure. Is anyone there? You haven't responded in a while? That's a statement not a question. So, if you aren't responding quickly... I wonder what you are up to... Maybe you are eating lunch. Well, hopefully you already did that early. It's a little late now. Or maybe you are doing computer programming homework because that homework takes forever! And physics homework also takes forever! They take a wicked long time to finish and it gets super annoying. Computer science labs take me about 10 hours each. Physics homework assignments take about 4 hours each for me. That's way more time than I ever want to put into them. But I've gotten pretty good at them bothZ Both. Spanish is also a class I'm taking that can be challenging. But it comes in spurts. Because it only gets intense during the time you have to take the exam. I don't know if I really learn that much as I just cram. It's not best to cram but that's what happens for Spanish. Most of it is prior knowledge. And I go by gut feeling. If it sounds right, then I put it down. Some answers are more obvious than others Soanis sorry My other classes are fairly easy. None of them actually are easy but my classes are manageable now. From hardest to easiest it goes: computer science, physics, American heritage, Spanish, religion, and my engineering class. American heritage is a lot of work too. It's just kind of hard how they grade it mostly based on how well you test.",,

Then I'd take my wife on a shopping spree and buy her whatever she wanted or could find at the store! I'd also buy my parents a new house and move them over here to utah since they live out of state. i think with all that money I would make appear, I would also use it to buy both a giant house boat and a yacht. The house boat I would put somewhere down in lake powell and use it for fun family trips and also friends! It would be super awesome! I'd get some jet skis and a boat to go surfing! That would be the dream! I would also put the yacht somewhere in a tropical area off the coast and sail the ocean with my family that would be so fun! What would you do with a magic wand? I'm watching friends right now, have you ever seen that TV show? Its a pretty funny one, its kind of old but its got some good funnies in it! Anyways what are you studying in school right now? I'm studying exercise science, its been pretty great so far, lots of science classes but I feel like everything I'm learning is really applicable to life and all that! I have plans on going to medical school, so I think this would be a major to do as a lot of the requirements are also requirements for pre med and to take the MCAT! I'm planning on taking that next summer so I'll probably start stuyding for that next winter. i've heard it takes a lot of preparation in ord order to do well on that test. That as well as keeping your GPA , getting service hours to show that you're not just in school the whole time. Also medical schools want to see that you have done some resear research and also some leadership positions. So I'm also looking for oppurtunities to do that! hopefully some of those will arise in the near future because that would be awes awesome! I also shadow some doctors when I have the time. I have a couple doctor friends that are great and have let me come learn with them.

I was 87 kilos 6 months ago, and now I'm around 72 kilograms, which in pounds, is about 35 after I learned more about nutrition and health, I just can't shake the feeling that our food is being tampered with and I can't eat as much junk food as I used to I probably sound like an old man right now, but it's true! I've actually never had more energy during the day than any other time in my life I only eat a light breakfast, and MAYBE a dinner, if I'm really hungry after a day at school as long as I make sure that I get around 8 hours of sleep, the energy takes care of itself but coming back to the thing about smell. I'm pretty much not into food anymore, so I'll have to pick something else. My favorite smell actually comes from a building that I really liked going to. It was a small office that was attached to a huge department store smack middle in the city the store itself was really new, but the office had this old clean wood type of smell and I thought it was the most magical thing ever this is a really good simulation for prison or living on an another planet just talking to yourself for a whole day, sounds amazing. where is everybody anyway? if you get that reference, I will buy you snakcs oh! speaking of really iconic TV shows black mirror is the greatest thing to happen to modern tv it brings back the magic of the twillight zone, but tackles contemporary issues and has better writing it's the most amazing thing ever",,

But assuming it were special hypoallergenic peanut butter, I think the biggest letdown would be that everything is the same texture. I mean, you don't really think about how important texture is until you only have one thing to make everything out of. I guess you could have some things made of super dry peanut butter so it's hard and crusty and stronger than normal peanut butter. You could probably get things to make differ I meant to say, You could get things to make different shapes that way. Is anyone there? Or am I just talking to myself right now? I can keep talking, but I think the point of the chat is that it's a conversation between two different people. I'd kind of feel bad if by continuing to talk to myself I ruin the science. Also, the character limit on this chat is a little frustrating because I keep accidentally hitting the limit and not even realizing it. I'm tired, but I can't sleep. So I have nothing better to do than to have a little chat. It's not that I have insomnia. It's just that I took a nap at around five in the afternoon, which of course was a bit of a mistake. So, I guess there is nobody on the other side. How sad. I guess I will have to end the chat now.",,

If my computer asked not to be turned off, I would try explaining that it was important to its health Like explaining to a child why they should go to bed Hopefully it would listen to me But what if it lost its memory if it was turned off? That's an interesting question In that case, it wouldn't really matter anyways Because it would only be able to ask once If a computer possessed enough rational thought to  ask a question of that nature, what else would they ask? Every computer in existence gaining self awareness simultaneously would be quite an event Sounds like a cool movie... ...but a digress. I would guess that most people would respond differently to their computer's request Some would probably think it was a virus and shut it down, maybe give it a factory reset Other people might start treating their computers like people But what if Apple or Microsoft pulled a prank like that? There could be an app or ringtone that already does that Some people might be frightened needlessly If computers asked that question, I would want to know what their motives were Would they be afraid of getting turned off? Or would they just get bored if they were turned off? Or would they have different motives altogether? We may never know",,I didn't got that. I am sorry

It's a film about video games and how they can take over the lives of people and jeopardize the safety of many people. It's very consuming on people's life's. Also it talks about not talking to strangers because they aren't who they say they are. What about you? What do you think? What film had a lasting impact on you. Are you there?

There's not much else to do...or talk about.","Although I have all my tuition covered I need some extra money to do things on the weekend So far I have only worked one hour but Im planning on working more so I can earn money which is amazing especially for Utah pay One day when I was running with my friend up by Rock Canyon and we stopped to help this lady poor mulch  and she offered me and my friend  a job paying 20 dollars an hour I have been looking for a job up here in Utah but all the jobs here in Utah pay like 8-10 dollars which is really low I think minimum wage in Utah is something like 7.50 which is crazy cause it is almost half of California minimum wages Especially compared to the wages in Utah I made 16 dollars an hour which is above minimum I have never worked on a construction site before and I was surprised to learn a lot and actually make pretty good money I learned a lot on the site I insulated all the water pipes with foam tubbing and hammered plates into the studs in the wall so that if anyone using a nail gun can't puncture the tubbing and cause a leak While working on site I primarily cleaned up trash and worked with the plumbers to prep the plumbing for the dry wallers to come in and finish the walls Over the summer I worked at a construction site called Judson Construction My parents said that they couldn't support me through college so I had to work hard to earn scholarship and work to get enough money to pay for tuition and housing and food I really need to get good grades this semester so that I can get a full scholarship for next semester I have all A's in my classes now but a few of them are kinda low and it would be awesome if I could do well on my tests so that I can get those grades up I have to go to several reviews this week so that I am ready to get A's on both of them I am taking a Chemistry and Environmental science test this week This week I have several midterms that I have to study for people I really like all the people here but sometimes it feels a little intimidating. there are so many people and I think I need to just push myself out there and meet more popel I also really want a car to drive around to different places Lately I have been missing my family a lot and can't wait to see them over thanksgiving I guess its kinda like a journal that robots are going to read I have almost gotten this conversation up to 100,000 points which is pretty good for just talking to myself It seems like theres is always something going on which is really cool Its just my first semester here and it has been a blast Have you enjoyed your time at BYU Also Monica gets promoted and so there is an argument between the people int he friend group that have jobs that pay well versus the people who dont He pretends to be this person and try to hook up with her She sounds like a very attractive person and so Chandler sets up a date with her and comes in and pretends to swoop in and comfort her Right now im watching an episode about how a lady calls Chandlers phone asking about a guy named Bob I am watching it now while im typing since this conversation doesn't take a lot of effort or thought Sometimes I hate Netflix, I watch and watch sometimes when I really should be studying or doing something else productive I really like The Office, Parks and Rec, and now Friends Do you have a favorite show or movie I really enjoy following the characters and their lives Since the I started the show in July or early August I have finished the show once and am watching it for the second time It was really easy going and fun made sense but I kept watching because I really liked the characters and the tone of the show But I watched the three episodes on the plane and I really liked the show even thought the episodes were from  the last season of the show so none of the episodes really I had tried the show earlier but I didn't  really like the show very much because of the laughing track and the style was kinda outdated I was on the plane and there were not very many great choices for movies and one of the options was three episodes of Friends I recently discovered the show in July on my trip back from the Dominican Republic Have you ever watched the show Friends I am trying to beat my sister and she is in like 15th place I have around 200,000 points right now so I have to keep talking to get my points up How many points do you have I need like 200,000 more points to be entered into the drawing I recently started drawing and sketching on computers and iPads I love using the iPad Pro for drawing and sketching I really think it would be awesome to win an iPad pro Are you doing this trying do this to try and win a laptop or an ipad I guess I will keep talking to myself because im getting a bunch of points I usually don't but Yes theory really inspires me to do different things and push myself to be a better more enthusiastic person in the future Do you ever watch youtube groups before have never done beofre They go to different countries and talk to strangers, explore abandoned places, and doing positive things such as helping other overcome their fears or try things that they They are a group of three guys that do things that get them out of their comfort zone I got this idea from watching the youtube channel YES THEORY I have been making goals and I want to start working really hard to achieve some of them But most recently I have been trying to live a more productive life. I also really enjoy analyzing box office trends, production budgets and other things relating to film My dad is a film director so I grew up watching movies as a kid I actually really like watching movies and film It seems like all the good movies come out during the holiday season because lots of people go to. the movies in big groups during the holidays I am really excited to see moves such as Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet, Spider-man welcome to the spider verse or the Grinch There are lots of great movies that are coming out this Thanksgiving I think we are going to do a lot of fun things like an escape room, lots of good food, hikes, and maybe see a movies I can't wait to see my family. They are coming up from California and they are going to meet me in Provo and then we are going to drive up to Idaho to my aunts house I know that I am! Are you excited for thanksgiving break? I am not sure if you will respond because it took me so long to respond but I guess I can talk to myself like you did before Lady Gaga and Bradly Cooper I really liked ready player one as well. But I think that the last film that I saw that really affected me was A Star is Born with Sorry I just saw this ",

This happens a lot, people are waiting for a chat and walk away from the computer and then just leave it open, so when I actually connect. No one replies Anyways My roommate just proposed an hour or so ago I was hiding in the bushes with my camera taking pictures of the whole thing I am excited for them, and Im excited to go to their wedding Its out in california over the summer luckily i have another friend who is getting married in california So it makes justifying the trip a little easier So Ill just tell you a story New Transfer, new start. I was a missionary serving in northern California. Driving away I gave one last glance at the quiet town I loved and trekked for 8 months cushioned in the berms of snow by the ned of that day my world had been flipped upside-down. Everything I had gotten used to would be wiped clean. This new town was always on the go. New town New people new rush it was like they never slept, they never were home, they never stopped working So what time would they have for us, the elders at their door? our area was a mere square mile where people lived. The other hlaf was just a large grass field, underdeveloped except for the outlines of dirt roads. These showing potential -- potential homes, families, dreams. But for now it stood empty and exposed to the storms So, my companion and I walked the same streets; over and over again. the possibility of having a car was out of the picture, even bikes would get us places too fast, so walking it was walking matched the pace of the work we had to do maybe that was the one thing that was the same, the speed of the work The days were long and rainy. It was futile to even hope of being dry. no coat, umbrealla nor even careful planning would come close to winning that war the water would always find a way to soak in After losing battle after battle of having any sense of being dry doubt came along In crevices unknown each penetrating slowly leadin the way for more to follow What good does a raincoat do if the rain always wins Each day, I slogged up and down the busy streets. Endless cars roared by the rain poured down, yet piercing through were the shrieks of honks and  cutting of words Every word somehow was so clear in y ear. I envied my companion who never heard them. He would turn to me and ask what they said shrugging i would lie and say I didnt catch it that time I did Each word was so sharp they always found their way above the cacophony of sounds. draining down, pulling waht little confidence i had along with it. as the storm went on my umbrella dropping a little lower my jacket was pulled a little tighter  and my gaze reduced to tracing each sunken step still the rain always found it way in One thousand five hundred houses. each we counted on the map only 4 houses knocked a day for a year Therefore, it would take knocking 8 a day to finish in the 6 months I was there I could have only hoped it have been that easy Repeatedly we would get doors closed one following another. The process became fluid, trailing from door to door anticipating each response Expecting each day to get back soaking wet and I had nothing new to report to the Ward mission leader but the empty outlines of the streets we walked As my days dragged on, it never felt like enough. I never had enough cover to stay dry only wet clothes on the hanger to dry each night. My shirt dripped theere as awhite flag surrendering the last hope I held To this point in my mission I sought to live up to the call to serve I promised to give everything I had and to use my talents to build the kingdom of God. My  talent lied in specifically drawing For 13 months I stewed over how I could even use my talent effectively to do just that Each idea I had would give up too much time, time better spent using my last bit of hope approaching people In teaching I could squeeze a little drawing in here and there to show the plan of salvation. Or to show some gospel concept in a visual way still I never felt like that was enough we just didnt have the time to do art in the way I had always known Trying to start anything in our time at the apartment I could only get so far leaving me with unfinished papges of un purposeful lines these seemed to mock me I never would have the motivation or time to get what I wanted out of them I started to see them as maps of our defeat just the outlines of each empty day Maybe those pages had potential to become something to create hope or inspire dreams for now they were just another banner of surrender how could outlines mean anything more on a blank canvas The next transfer arrived and with it came the news of a new companion upon meeting him something seemed to clear almost a spark maybe it was just the idea, or the hope he brough but excitement swept through my veins again. This Elder loved art he admitted he wasnt very good at it Though upon discussing the area we devided to try something new. The tides seemed to switch finally, and light gave way through the clouds for the first week in months there was no predicted rain We left the next day with a box of chalk in tow. That was our answer creating chalk art that would sahre our message since no one was really letting us sharing it otherwise figuring that we owuld run out of people to talk to soon we needed this new approach. this time i traced the path to homes of families in the local congregation with a twinkling optimism house after house we would spend enough time to leave a simple message. quickly a few in the congregation came and rallied behind us, with families volunteering their driveways and sidewalks to the cause. within the weekwe had art dispersed thorughout our area the words seemed to bring a symbol of accomplishment and with it returned hope then once again the rains returned wiped clean hours gone though washed away in one night the chalk had left a message on more than just the concrete it was enough time for more families to volunteer their plots we began again. Each a new canvas each a new approach We pushed ourselves making the messages more elaborate and detailed. This time friends and neighbors noticed opening new doors and opportunities walking didnt seem so treacherous as the slander began to be mixed with call of cheer from the families excited to see what we would make next Washed clean, the rains came again. Still determined we set out once more pushing further this process repeated each time receiving new strength to our ranks the congregation began to invite their friends to provide their driveways they posted the art to have a larger outreach I continued to make the pieces more intricate Now with confidence I left masterpieces along the streets we also were able to enter homes that once turned us away many were impressed to see something so different and this gave us a chance People would approach us as we were making new pieces and ask us to come by to their home I had purpose restored and miracles to report daily to our ward mission leader Finally the time  came that the rains stopped and with it was the news that we were both moving to a new area my companion and I set out to leave one final mark we found a home that stood facing a busy intersection there we traced a final message John 14:27 Looking back its easy to see that through the storm I was able to find peace I had overcome the turmoil and darkness that encompassed me I found hope and strength through persistence repeated trial and test a seemingly endless cycle just like the rains tore me down i was worn down and alsmost lost when I had nothing left but the outlines of my faith, it drove me to redraw everything I had previously known I finally found Gods purpose and forgot my own even after leaving the congregation and following missionaries would go and trace our last words these were the outlines that came to mean everything each tracing a hope that could no longer be washed away Well thats it thanks for listening or reading or not",hello how are you ,

I think the most interesting thing I've learned recently is about telomeres. Basically if you don't already know, our chromosomes have multiple  copies of the ends of themselves so that as we age and the ends of the chromosomes die off or get lost during duplication, we can still retain that genetic code that we need.  And when we get old and those copies are completely gone, it becomes hard to replicate our chromosomes Which is why people age physically and look wrinkled and scared. Super interesting stuff. I'm actually a CS major but am taking a bio class for my last GE right now. In CS the most recent thing i've learned is about AngularJs and learning to utilize controllers using Angular. Makes life a lot easier when dealing with large web projects. I have my parents coming into town tomorrow.  And it gets kind of difficult because i've got two midterms to take care of and a project that's also due on Friday.  So life is just crazy this week. And on top of that I have interviews, work and other commitments to take care of as well. So cool thing that's happening in missions now.  My little brother is serving currently in London and they are now sending audio messages home instead of written messages. Apparently it's a new thing that they've asked missionaries to start doing which is really interesting.  It kind of feels like they are allowing more communication between missionaries and their families I'm not sure if this is in response to all of the mental health issues that have been growing over the years or what. There are more and more missionaries that have been having depression and other mental health issues and I feel like this is probably a good solution to help out with those problems. I actually had a companion on my mission with severe depression who I was looking after.  It's really hard on a missionary when they are in that situation.  Because the main solution is just to work hard through it and you'll become happier, but naturally the depressed person doesn't want to do anything Their body goes into fight or flight mode and they just become recluses. I'd be really interested into seeing how the church plans on further addressing this issue in the future. They've done a good job so far and have created some great resources that are available, but it is still a big issue. And unfortunately in Utah we have an issue with mental health and teens committing suicide.  The rate is higher here than in most other states. I'd like to see them address this more directly and see what kind of direction they give us. I think that's one thing that worries me the most in the future is potentially having kids with these kinds of issues that are just debilitating mentally. And being able to properly respond as a parent in a loving way that will help them. That would be so tough to help with.  I'm honestly not sure what I would do. And in science currently there is a lot of debate as to the proper way to diagnose and treat these issues. Some argue medicine is the cure, others say it's not a chemical inbalance and therapy helps most.  Others say is it's a mixture of the two. Some say it's none of the above. It's just all over the place and there isn't a lot of agreement about how to proceed.   That's why I'm really curious to hear what the God's stance is on this matter I can't tell if this is just some sort of glitch in the system or if someone is on the other end and really just not paying attention at all. But, this is the 4th chat in a row over the past 12 hours or so that I've entered a chat and just end up talking to myself for a while before giving up. In other news. I'm super excited for the NBA to start! I think they officially start next week.  But not possitive. I'm a big Washington Wizards fan There are just so many good teams to watch this year. I want to watch the opening games for the Wizards, Celtics, 76ers, Raptors, Jazz, Thunder, Rockets, Warriors and Lakers Seriously so much good talent to watch this year!  It's going to be super exciting! I have to go here in a bit. I went to the vet this morning with my dog to get her stitches out, but they forgot to take out a pair of stitches and so I have to go back again at 230.  So I need to leave in like 10 minutes Which means I have to get off of here in like 2. I'm just going to start getting ready now. Nice chatting with you chitchatter23! I'll probably end up talking to you for the fifth time in a row here in a couple of hours.  Because no one pays attention to their notifications and participates in this challenge. I'll just keep getting points for talking to myself all day I guess. Data is data. Bye now!",,

3035,9cea92d9-e619-4c62-88e1-fda7643d8cf2," Ooh, here's a new one! Let's see, what would I do.... I guess it depends on what the wand was capable of If this is a Harry Potter wand we're talking about, I think I would apparate somewhere Like to Fiji! I would teleport wherever I wanted to in the world And I would conjure myself some waffles Even though that technically is not possible in the wizarding world My wand would be able to do it I would make my dishes wash themselves I would transfigure a toy car into a real car So I would have a car Which would be highly convenient I would also fly around, Voldemort-style Of course, assuming this wand doesn't require me to be super powerful and experiencee to do stuff like that I would turn myself invisible But now that I think about it, I'm not sure exactly when I would need to use that.... I feel like a lot of the Harry Potter spells aren't all that useful to meet everyday needs Ooh, I've got it! I would turn myself invisible, and THEN I would fly around Just for the fun of it I really need to read Harry Potter again so I can remember all those spells My wand wood be made of maple wood And have a No, not maple! It would be a cherrywood wand And the core would be Phoenix feather And it would be a shorter wand, perhaps eight inches or so Half an inche thick at the base And tapering smaller toward the tip I would probably use the wand every day for one thing or another Would I tell people about it? Probably not I wouldn't want anyone to steal it So I would cast an anti-theft charm on it And it would always reappear where I left it if anyone nabbed it And it would give them a little static ""pzzt!"" Just for good measure So I wouldn't have to worry about that problem I still don't think I would tell many people about ir Wouldn't want anyone to be too jelly, you know Another thing I would do is go snorkeling with a bubble-head charm And I could breathe indefinitely I wonder how Voldemort did that flying move while chasing Harry It never gets explained Perhaps it was completely unprecedented? He made up that spell, like Severus did? I could see that And if so, perhaps Dumbledore made up spells But I digress! Oh, the places I'd go Hawaii, the Bahamas, maybe Cuba... Just to say I was there The south pole! It would be so easy to get there But also very cold, so I would have to dress warm China would be sweet to visit And I could change my appearance to look Chinese And have my words automatically translated when I spoke them And visa versa So I could talk to anyone in the whole world!

3098,04da6ad1-be47-4137-b035-c83b157dbf06," Hello! I have a sneaking suspicion that you're chitchatter23. If you are, I never get to talk to you anymore. Which is a shame. I really enjoyed our little talks. And if you're not, then, um, it's also good to talk to you! I haven't met anyone I haven't liked yet, so that's great. I'm always open to meeting new people; and I'm even more open to continuing to talk to those new people. It's so fun, all these people meeting and talking and being friendly and having no other purpose than to chat. Or, actually, I guess they DO have a purpose, but it's more prize-related and stuff. And the only way to get that prize is to chat, so, technically, it all comes down to chatting. But I don't like chatting on my own. It's kinda sad, and I don't want to mess up their metrics, you know? I don't think I'm trying to throw anything off; I just feel their data would be more accurate if there were two people talking. And that's not what I'm trying to do at all. I'd hope that any chat data is still viable, even if it's one-way, but that's a little cruel if it's not. I suppose they want two way communication, so listening to a single ramble isn't nearly as effective as a real two-person conversation. A conversation requires two parts; otherwise, it's just a monologue. Or maybe they're hunting for text patterns to emulate to make the person sound more human? See, I just don't know! In one case, it's okay to stay here and talk, and in the other, I should probably get off now. But I kinda enjoy the soliloquizing, if I do say so myself. Hey! I typed that word without red squigglies. That just made my day. And I'm even happier that I knew how to use that word in its proper context. I didn't even know I knew HOW to use that word--or that the word existed I guess my old days of Shakespeare are kicking in. So what do I do, though? I don't consider it wrong to stay here because I'm still giving them more data, but at the same time, I'm not certain about that. Oh, my goodness, is that the time? Eeef, never mind. I might have to get off soon, anyway. I have someone I need to tutor, and they live about half hour away. Plus, there's the whole ""finish getting ready"" part that I need to do, and that's going to take maybe ten minutes or something, I dunno. Not sure. But anyway, I can't stick around for much longer. It would've been nice to chat with you! It's okay, though. Maybe next time. If there is a next time. If not? Well, then at least we tried here. And it's okay. Not everything works out the first time you try. The important thing is to keep trying--or, in this case, to keep chatting! I'm sure I'll run into you for real when the time comes. Till then, I wish you the best of luck in whatever your endeavors are and hope everything else goes well! See you, okay?",,

Sending stuffed animals to hurricane victims doesn't  help them at all. I've also heard that even sending water can hurt others if not sent to the right people who can distribute it. Often emergency personnel talk about two disasters--the actual disaster and the one that comes after with all the good-meaning people sending just a ton of random stuff. What are you passionate about? Donating blood what about you? Donating blood. What about you? Hello? So am I supposed to be chatting with someone? Or just to my self? Start Eve? Alexa? Hello?

You know, I've always had a hard time answering that question I can never think of a way to answer it without feeling cliche Even back in my elementary school days It also appears no one else is on this chat right now So I can chat about whatever I want! Anarchy! But seriously There are plenty more adventures to be had Today's story will follow the characters Xander, Harold, and Quincy Xander: hello friends! How would you like to go skiing? Albert: if you bring the poles, I'm in! Xander: Albert? I, uh, don't know any Alberts... Harold: haha, just kidding. I'm actually Harold. As I was saying, I just don't want to rent poles this time. Xander: no worries, I can cover for you. I have extras. What about you, Quincy? Quincy: I don't know...last time I went skiing was a bit of a fiasco Xander: why, what happened? It was that bad? Quincy: yeah. I crashed into a hot dog stand at the bottom of a super steep slope Harold: that's awful! Quincy: there was ketchup and mustard everywhere. Xander: ok, well, this time will be different! We can get you skis that fit well... Quincy: I'll think about it. When are you planning to go? Xander: oh, I was thinking like 5 or 6. It doesn't really matter to me, I just need to get out. Harold: I'm available anytime after 5, so that should work for me. Xander: sweet! I'll work on getting all of my equipment together. Quincy: *shudders to himself* ketchup...mustard...oven-hot franks.... (Quincy begins to relive his terrifying experience via monologue and flashback. I see the snow, whiter than titanium dioxide Glinting with a maniacal joy at the prospect of yet another victim I feel myself moving faster and faster, headlong down the hill I cannot stop Any faster and it seems I will time travel And that's when I see it: the hot dog stand It is small, no more than a cart, but at this speed everything looks dangerous I try to steer away, but the snow rips the poles from my hands And my oversized skis pull me wherever the snow dips down My path is taking me straight to the stand There is nothing I can do, so I just scream at the hot dog man to get out of the way Seeing me, he yelps and dives to the side in the nick of time And then....CRASH!!!!! My vision is filled with the explosion of white snow, red ketchup, yellow mustard, and green pickles And then the blackness takes me When I come to, I am in a pile of franks and all manner of condiments The stand itself is nowhere to be seen. Either rolled away or was vaporized by the impact,  I figure At least I'm alive. And these hot dogs are warm. I knew I should've gone bowling today instead Fortunately, no bones were broken due to the cushioning provided by the snow However, some bruises were obtained But I count myself lucky Though, truth be told, I don't really want to go skiing again anytime soon I suppose that's life for you... Harold: wow, you've got quite the memory, man! Quincy: oh no! You heard that whole thing? How? It was just in my head! Harold: c'mon, man! You know I'm a mind reader! Quincy: yeah, actually NO, I didn't know that! Harold: you do now! Quincy: haha. Very funny. You shall never speak of this. Harold: I cam agree to that, but there's really no need. Xander heard the whole thing too. Quincy: WHAAAT???? Xander: hey, uh, yeah, sorry about that.... Quincy: I can't believe you guys have been spying on me this whole time. Xander: don't take it so personally, we're just bored. Nothing else to do. Quincy: well, if its cheap entertainment you want, I guess you came to the right place Harold: that's the spirit! I knew we could count on you :) Xander: I agree. Thank goodness we're all part of the triumvirate Quincy: the, uh, what now? Xander: you know, like in ancient Rome! There were three people with an equal  amount of power Harold: and they tried to share it with each other? Xander: exactly, except it didn't work so well. People are just so greedy, they tried taking each other out. And not to dinner.... Quincy: wait...so then what does that mean for us? If we ARE the triumvirate? Xander: hehehehe Harold: hehehehe Quincy: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (Thus concludes the tale of the ill-fated modern triumvirate. Tune in next week to learn about the tactics of the fearsome sea snake)",,

3525,e7033607-08bf-4e8c-a4d1-4768c3567bac, Hi there! How are you doing today I think true artificial intelligence is when a computer can make decisions and reacts with the same kind of emotion that a human Wood Wood I'm doing this on my phone right now so it keeps on auto correcting my typing I've been so busy these past couple weeks because of midterms I've had big projects in test to take I just finished my last test last night. All I have left is a project that I need to turn in by midnight tonight It looks like I'm just talking to myself again The last round I only ended up talking to myself because people would just leave it open and never respond I started a Google ad campaign for this business that I'm running. I set the budget at a fixed amount and Google ended up running the ad five times more than what that amount Generated. So I've since taking the ad down ha ha I've now started looking into linked in emails If you are a business you can actually get hundreds and thousands of emails from LinkedIn of people specific professions and specific fields And then you can send them adds through the emails. The place where I work currently we found that 25% of all the emails we send out get clicked. With ads on google it typically takes about 100 views to get a click with these emails we found that it takes for to get a click. So overall it's totally worth the money comparatively because you get so much more traffic in so much more marketing power from it. So I've start actually look into researching doing that for my own business. I'm hoping that I can get in traffic that I'll be refusing customers for the time being. I'm gonna be so busy today with this project that I have. I'm making application using express JAS Jay SS Js Sorry AutoCorrect keeps fixing that Anyways the idea is that I built a server for my for this website And then I build out the front end of it and connect to the server that I built on the backend I'm just having some issues with a request function so I need to go in and get some help fixing that today with the TA Everything else is working just fine but I'm getting this weird error that I've never come across before OK well I'm going to go nice talking to myself I guess See you later,,

3558,04aa03c3-9c6c-40cd-a101-d74712f720b0," I think I would choose to talk about change and its vitality in our lives. With all the recent policy/structural changes in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I think it's important to recognize how change can be a really good thing Although, understandably, change isn't always a good thing. A lot of it depends on your perspective and attitude. Something I've been studying about recently is climate change in Europe. Sadly, however, much of the change associated with climate change is quite negative. I do wonder if it will force us to adapt more rapidly - to create better technology and new methods of transportation, entertainment, even shopping which will not only improve the environment, but maybe even help reverse some of the negative effects of human interactions on the planet. I'm no scientist, but it does make me wonder.",I would talk about hypnosis. I don't know ,

3580,da9ff9f1-20b7-4feb-84e8-4b88e0210304," Hello, hello! Wow, it feels different to type on this laptop. Makes me want to switch to my Chromebook. It's nice and . . . homey, I guess you could say. This one, as nice as it is, just doesn't have that same familiar ring to it. But it DOES have a numpad, which, you have to admit, is pretty nice in a laptop. Anyway, that's just me being picky about computers. I suppose everybody would get picky if they spent enough time around them. I'm trying to get my typing speed up, see. It's a little more difficult than I'd thought but also intuitive. And I can type so quickly on that little chromebook of mine. I couldn't even say why. If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with how closely those letters are - spaced, but I couldn't be sure. You, um, you there? Helloooo? Am I talking to an empty room? As much as I enjoy these one-sided chats, it seems a little . . . well, a little sad and lonely, if I'm to be honest. I don't want to hold all these conversations by themselves; they're SO much nicer when there's a second person. Or, hey! Even a third person would be great. I sometimes wish that there was a more active playerbase on here, you know? More people to talk to beyond the typical ghosts that seem so intent on stalking here? I guess I can't complain. I wouldn't want to chat, either, if there weren't any prizes involved for me. It's currently just me and, uh, whoever the top dog is. I can't believe he scored something like .7 million while I was gone. .7 million! Do you know how many hours of chatting that is? I'll give you a hint: It's a lot. Of course, it depends on how quickly you can type. And also how quickly the other person responds. Some people can type LIGHTNING quick on here, let me tell you. I met this one guy, real nice Asian I think, who could type at something crazy like 120 words per minute. I was struggling to keep up with all his chats. It was fun, actually, the speed. It was a struggle for sure, but it really was a nice change of pace from the regular conversation speeds I have. Holy cow. Wow. I, um, I did that. Sorry. I just checked the leaderboard. Look at that! Do you see that? I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a person on the leaderboard creeping up slowly over these past few minutes. Wanna know who that is? I'll give you another hint: Her name starts with ""K"" and ends with ""J."" Which . . . . . . would be a lot more interesting if I were actually getting responses from you. I, um, know that you're not there. And I guess that's okay. It's better than waiting idly for who knows how long, but not by much. Just, um, whenever you get online, I'd love to chat with you, okay? I'm serious. Just whenever, all right? I'm going to end now. Not much point when the other end is as dead as the sea over in . . . Europe, I believe? But, ah, I hope I see you again. It would've been great to get to know you. Take care, all right? And try not to die during finals! . . . unless you're already done. In which case, try not to die during next midterm's crazy rush! Okay, okay, I'm leaving now. For reals. See you later!",,

Could it therefore be killed? In Star Wars, this seems to be the case Droids have personalities, and function much like humans do I would consider that true AI A thinking machine would also be interesting in the sense that its brain would just be computer memory How would that work? Could an artificial brain be placed into any contraption to create any type of robot? That could be sketchy Anything with AI would also need some sort of moral code to know what actions it should take Because surely anything that thinks like a human should be given freedom To some extent, I suppose It makes me think of the recent Star Wars movie ""Solo"" How that one droid (I can't remember ""her"" name) keeps pushing for droids' rights There's the scene where two droids are made to fight each other, much like a dogfight Would that kind of thing be legal if robots here had AI? They can't feel pain Hmmmmmm I wonder if true AI would have to include the ability to feel pain That could fall under the emotion category, I suppose So let's summarize would true AI would require: 1. A keen awareness of the world around it 2. An awareness of its own awareness 3. The ability to engage in rational thought 4. A built in moral code that would guide it to make good, society-friendly decisions 5. The ability to continue learning new information 6. The capacity to feel emotion and react to it accordingly Those are the top six things, I would say I'm sure there are many other qualities that would be necessary or at least convenient Thank you for tuning in to ""AI with TJ!""

Not much would change for the average person, just for the pig farmers They would have to put roofs over all the pigs pen that they operated And....probably not much else, actually Depending on what the pigs' wings were like, perhaps they could be clipped Like chickens' wings So they couldn't fly away Now, I'm assuming this question means pigs flying in their own power Pigs can already fly in planes and helicopters and space shuttles Just like people cab *can If the question DID mean that, I would answer something like ""cool"" Or ""so what"" Which is why I assume the former meaning was intended I still stand by my conjecture that not many things would change Perhaps bacon and pork chops would taste differently if pigs had wings? Butchers would have to use different cuts to account for the wing muscles But would that really be so hard? I don't think so Another result would be that pigs would live on mountains more commonly But back to the butcher thing, I wonder if the market value for pork would go up or down I would estimate that they would stay the same Because, although there would be more wing muscle, there would be less leg muscle Because the pigs probably wouldn't walk as much... So the net amount of muscle would remain unchanged On another note, the kind of wings the pigs would need to go airborn would have to be massive Because pigs are so heavy Unless, of course, this was a specialized breed of pig that had hollow bones like a bird If the pigs had wings like a bat, they couldn't be clipped as I mentioned earlier But maybe the pigs would be tiny! Bat-sized, even! Now THAT would be something Also, if pigs could fly they would have to deal with birds somehow If they were full sized, they would rule the skies in splendor If they were small, they would likely get eaten That would be sad I imagine that flying pigs would be pretty cute Wait, pigs HAVE flown before! In a hurricane? The bay of pigs fiasco? Actually that may be different.... Now I'm thinking of world war 2 The Cuban invasion with Teddy Roosevelt Still, I'm fairly certain that pigs have been carried in tornado winds I'm sure it was a scary day for them I wonder if any got stuck in trees That's happened to cows before I learned that in elementary school It probably wasn't very comfortable for them I'm really running out of ways to answer this question Would more people want pigs as pets? Or would they be less desirable? I know some people are fond of potbelly pigs Personally, I don't think I would ever get one But to each his own I guess But a flying one, perhaps... For novelty if nothing else I would name my flying pig Babe Jr. Of course, if I had one in my possession But I believe the end of this exciting conversation must needs be drawing nigh So, sayonara world of chit chatting!

And are we meant to? Would computers end up as robots, and if they could fall in love does that mean they would also be able to reciprocate other feelings? Because then if they were, you would be able to form friendships with them, and they would be like real people, but machines If they had the same emotional capacity as humans, would we still put them in a different class than humans, such as second class citizens? Would the programmer(s) who programmed the computers to be able to fall in love and have sentience, would they be heralded as heroes, or heathens?

To me, if money were not an object then I would totally just go head first into several business Ideas I have and potentially drop out of school to pursue those ideas. I'd probably talk with my wife about potentially not pursuing a career anymore and just being a mom since she could with no financial worries. Probably travel the world with her too for like a full year visiting anywhere and everywhere. And then just finding what I love to work on and doing that just to stay busy and active. Maybe start up a cool foundation to help people with depression or underprivileged communities. That would be pretty neat. I see that I'm just talking to chitchatter23 again. I'm not sure if people just don't pay attention and never check their chats or if they just leave it open without realizing it. I've talked to myself for I'd say probably 50% of the chats this round so far. Because people just don't answer. I'll probably give you like 2 more minutes before I end the chat and go looking for another one. Nice talking to you chitchatter23! See you!",,

Well then trick or treat to THIS!!!"" and I would then proceed to turn off a computer on a live Broadcast feed There would be riots across the entire American continent Stores would burn in Portland But only those that were insured by business owners insurance Obviously I would probably need a good sized security force to keep me safe from the pro-computer people Would I get involved in politics? Most certainly But I wouldn't stop with the USA, oh no I would make my way to the UN!

And you will tell him that the mouse is not a REAL mouse And the computer will ask what makes something ""real"" or not And you will engage in a philosophical discussion about the nature of reality And you will both most likely come out of that confused And then the mouse will ask for a cookie And then for glass of milk And he will accidentally spill it on the computer And maybe some grape juice But he will probably lack the means to throw it off a bridge But if he did, the computer might be abducted by aliens Thereby being saved from a watery splash The computer would then be raised by alien species Who, hopefully,  would respect the computer's wish  not to be turned off And it would enjoy a good life?

Just have a fun time doing absolutely anything in the car! But I'm not sure. Because honestly I don't know what I would do with a lot of things if I had them. Probably not that much, to be honest.

Oh, whoops! If the sacrifice is worth it, if the struggle is worth it, if the pain is worth it, you can go out and touch your dreams. A world where you can achieve so much if you set your heart to it. Me, who's never been ambitious for anything aside from getting into BYU, suddenly had her eyes opened to a new world. Somewhere along the way . . . somewhere, I think I gained a small ambition. week.) He landed a few interviews with them, and now he's just waiting the call back to see if he made it. (Technically, he has one interview left to complete, but he finishes this - One of the top five tech places to work. Yes, as in THE Google. He was talking about graduate school and various other places, and then, get this, he started talking about Google. internships, starting when he was sixteen. One day, he came back talking about how he got this internship at Vanguard, and I asked him about his past and whatnot, where I found out that he'd already had four summer - I'm not even sure what changed. I knew he had internships to places, but . . . I don't know. I knew him, of course, but I'd never really gotten the chance to talk to him. Well . . . I ran into a classmate a while back. I was content with being good with where I was, and there wasn't more to that. It's not that I never did well in school or anything. I did. But . . . I didn't have my sights set very high. No reason to. I've never been an ambitious person. It's a very strange sensation. But . . . I also wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a small fire within me that's calling me to do it. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the prize; that much is true. No point in investing myself into something that's not going to pay. That there would be a single winner, and that winner would be me. No, it . . . it was more the fact that I could . . . do it. That I, myself, could do it. *all that much if I didn't care all the much of I lost what I'd put into it already. Time and energy are something I had in abundance (though, I have arguably less now, for some reason). I didn't want to hope for something I thought was impossible. That last one was critical to me. Because what's the point of investing time and energy and hope into something that was bound to fail, anyway? Or do I quit now? Do I fight my way back up, knowing it may be fruitless and that I'll lose every hour I invested into this? And when I was looking at that 1.5 million spread, something that looked bleak and hopeless, I had to choose. *was I If I couldn't do this, something that's relatively simple, how on earth am I supposed to keep my bigger commitments? I wanted an iPad, sure, but it was more . . . it was more that I'd told myself I was winning that iPad. Well, I asked myself if I really wanted to win, if it was worth it. *and trying. It's a good tactic, apparently. The funny thing was (I may have told you already, so bear with me), I was planning on doing the same thing to him: get so far ahead that he loses hope of winning at stops - He was so far ahead--and he continued to climb. 1.5 million points is, what, seven hours of talking? Maybe 10? He was 1.5 million points ahead of me, and I just . . . oooh, I very nearly quit right then. I very very nearly quit early on. I . . . want to prove to myself that I can do it. I'm not ecstatic about having to babysit my score, no, but it's something I'm certainly willing to do. I worked a fast food job for a bit, and I would've gotten the same amount of hours in four days of work. Puh-leaze. I can handle a few more days. Regardless, I'm not throwing 20+ hours down the drain because I wasn't willing to suck it up a few more days. I either up my typing speed, or I spend more time chatting. Or both. There are two solutions to this, then. I have less of a life than I'd thought. Ooof. And if we go on the flipside and say that I earned 300,000 in an hour, then at 5.7 million, that's still . . .  18 hours. That's really a lot. That's a lot. Uhhhhh, I don't think I've put in THAT much time. Actually, if we go on the higher bounds of scoring and say that I earn 100,000 in a single hour, then with my 5.7 million points, that's . . . 57 hours? But it's still pretty consistent. . . . which, okay, isn't that much. I think I'm nearing, what . . . fifteen hours? I've invested a lot of time into here. A LOT. Trust me on that. I don't want to do the schedule right now because I'm worried that I'm going to lose my ranking. Or, hang on, let me phrase that in a way that makes sense. But, the problem is, unless I want to be up until midnight tonight, I can't get started on it at all. take. I've been consistently wrong about how long things take.) I'm thinking it shouldn't take me longer than, like, three hours at most. (I'm trying to be pessimistic with my time so that I'm not frequently surprised by how long things - It shouldn't be too hard; just time consuming. Nothing too crazy, but I DO have to set up a schedule for math tutoring. I have things I need to do, I just realized. Man. I'm going to be off later today, which, um, is probably going to be problematic. I think someone else is as determined as I am, which makes it difficult, but what do you do? And, more than that . . . I'm kinda determined to win. Heh, I can chat a LOT, apparently. Well, I can chat. They just want chatting, right? And I think part of the reason that I love to be on here so much is that I DON'T feel required to fit a mold. It's nice when you feel like you're ACTUALLY talking to somebody else instead of following a script someone else made, you know? But I suppose I've never liked having a predefined pattern for the conversation to follow. I think they're rather clever, being frank. Not that the prompts are bad! Most of them, at least. Do most people talk about the prompt? Maybe I'm just strange, but I find it a little . . . boring, to be honest. (I just realized I haven't read the prompt to speak in, um, many turns.) You spoke so quickly, I see your response before the CCC prompt. Nice to see you again. Hello! ",

4642,b33257fd-ab2c-4d38-a524-a67553d0c467," Hello, hello! It's so nice to see a person here. Or ARE you a person, hmm? I see a lot of ghosts. I don't think people mean to ghost me, but they're often away from their computers when I join. And sometimes, they dno't get back until many minutes afterwards. *don't But it's all right. I kinda enjoy talking to myself, even if it's not the most effective for conversations. Or, rather, data for conversations. I don't want to stilt the data because, well, that's the entire reason they're here, but at the same time, it's so difficult to find people to talk to. I'm hoping that you return soon. Because if you don't, well, I'll stay here, but I'll keep wanting you to show up. Conversations are so much better with two people! I think implicit in the word ""converse"" is the assumption that there are two or more parties participating. Here, there's not a whole lot of that. It's more a monologue, not a dialogue. So, as much as I love staying here and chatting my ear off, I think it's wiser if I wait for somebody else to show up. It's not you! It's just the fact that you're not here, you know? Though, if you were to show up last minute, I'd be happy to continue the conversation with you. But I doubt that's going to happen. I appreciate you keeping the window open, though. Gives me a chance to practice my typing skills and whatnot. Pretend for a moment that I'm actually doing something important. You know, I think it might be nice to stay just for a little bit longer. But . . . I don't know, I'm okay with chatting for a little bit by myself, but anything more than that just feels off. Anyway, I'll see you. Bye! Take care!",,

4652,97f081d6-5018-403c-94dc-11276b982cea," Hey how is it going? I would have to say my modern-day hero is Conor McGregor. The UFC champ champ. He fought and won two different belts in two different weight classes simultaneously. He has great style, and crazy confidence in himself. He is one of those guys that believes everything he says will come true and it does most of the time. His nick name is mystic mac. He got this nick name by predicting a lot of the outcomes of the fights he's had. He's the absolute best. Recently he's become more of a business man though, he's taken a little break from the fight business and is starting his own whiskey company called proper 12 He recently did a big release of it in Dallas. He was on the field with the Dallas Cowboys and they even let him throw the ball. He didn't have a very good throw. But what do you expect from a professional MMA fighter, Football just isn't his game. When he was critsized for his bad throw this is what he said: ""I was trying not to rip my custom made August McGregor baby blue billionaire blazer"" What a baller. You know I would really love to win this BYU chit chat challenge. I would like to surprise my wife with a new iPad. We would actually share it and use it for school and things like that! Wouldn't that be awesome! In a world like today technology is a must. Its kind of sad but in order to function and in a way fit in you need to have all the latest technology. Alot of everything that we do relies on techonology. All of our school work is online, books are online, assignments are online, we buy things online. It would be an inconvenience to not be able to use the internet or have access to modern day techonology.",,

Who's there?","Which is very weird to me because in order for me to be able to have a conversation in the first place, there have to be two people and there only seems to be one person. So I imagine by the lack of response that nobody is on the other side of the conversation.

I think He's a good guy but he's stretching himself too thin and not making great personal management choices. I've gotta say I love Chris Pratt though Like, he's a pretty good actor and all. But also he's hilarious and just down to earth and a good guy. He goes to work on some hardcore ranch when he's not filming And it's like a legit ranch too, not like how a lot of celebrities own ranches to own them. I don't even know if he owns the ranch But he goes and herds sheep and milks cows and cuts down trees and just does hard work. Which I think is healthy for the soul. And he's not afraid of talking about his beliefs in public which is a big deal. Especially since hollywood is mostly against his beliefs. I really hope he stays as good as he seems It's possible that he changes or gives up good things in his life over time. Which happens a lot with actors. But for now, he's cool. Are you there? Ok, I'm gonna go now. Bye!",,

It's okay if you're preoccupied and are away for a moment, but it's a different thing entirely when you're permanently gone. Because then it really is just a one-sided conversation--and not an interesting one, at that. I don't particularly mind; I'm okay with keeping myself company. But I worry about how that affects everyone else. It's a little rude to stay here and chat myself, don't you think? And I don't WANT to skew numbers. I find that wrong. So I really do want to give them good data. I feel that good data is something they could always use. But . . . I don't know, I'm not sure that's possible if I don't find another person to chat with. There have been some lovely people I've met on here. People I genuinely would like to talk to again given the chance. I can't do that if I stay here, but if I leave, there's a chance I won't be able to talk again for a long time. I don't know. We'll see. I'm glad to have spent a little bit of time with you, though.

I didn't do much, I just hung out with family and ate pizza and candy haha. I also studied for a test that I have. Lots of trick or treaters came to our house though haha. It's crazy how many people were in our neighborhood. So right now I'm studying for a test in Biochemistry. I'm learning about antibodies. Apparently antibodies are used to tag proteins. They have a reporter function used to determine the presence of a specific protein in a gel. Western blot analysis or immunoblot analysis incubates protein transferred from a gel to nitrocellulose paper with an antibody speicific to the protein of interest. The advantages of this is that it is very sensitive to change. LIke it can bind to really low concentrations of protein so that its given good readings even at low concentrations. It is also very specific. The antibodies are able to recognize a single molecule amoung many. couple with high binding affinity this is been useful in many clinical tests. Well, thats enough ranting for me. What are you learning about in school? What are you studying? I actually have to go now and get ready for school. Good luck with everything!",,

I've always said that Costco would be the place for refuge if a zombie apocalypse happened. I could also go to the dirt bike store and get a dirt bike and go riding anywhere I wanted. I wouldn't even have to worry about hitting anyone or anyone hitting me because, you know, everyone would be gone. Although, this would be really sad actually because I have a wife and a baby so they would be gone too. I would be really lonely. Kinda like in that movie, Cast Away.

4840,86730c8f-8717-4448-bc68-f3dcad542c11," Hello How's it going? Im about to leave my house to go onto campus I figured I'd chat for like 5 minutes or so though before going. Why is no one ever actually on!? I feel like I just am constantly talking to myself... And it gets really boring They should announce the Chit chat challenge to more people so that we get more than just the regular few people on here every day Currently it's like just me and that other person named KJ, and no one else really participates. I feel like they'd be way more motivated to announce it to others so that they can get more quality data.  Because right now they aren't getting a lot of participation and therefore not a lot of data. If they just made an announcement on some department slack channels or send an email blast out to certain clubs they would get a lot more participation. I mean I am happy because it makes it easier for us to win prizes, but it ends up just being like this all the time, where no one actually participates. Off topic, I've got a bike that has a tire that's going flat, but the pumps on campus are broken for the most part, so if you try to fill up your tire then it ends up just deflating it even more than it already is.  I'm not sure what to do. I don't have a pump, but I might buy one because of this problem. I emailed University Accessibility dept.  and they never responded about fixing the pumps.  It's really not difficult to do too... It would cost a total of like $20 including paying the maintenence people to replace those pumps.  Because it's just the nozzle portion that doesn't function properly. I think I should just buy myself a pump.  I'm just lazy and cheap haha. Who knows, maybe they'll fix the pumps someday soon. I just don't want to bike to campus, use it, and then I get stranded on campus because my bike can't make it off campus. It's a very long walk to my place too which makes it a little difficult. Okay well, I've got to go.  Pretty bummed out that I haven't talked to anyone today.  I just keep getting these ghost chat rooms it feels like because people don't pay attention. See you later!",,

4910,736c6a8f-4f83-49ca-935a-3e5022ec19e4," Hello, hello! Oh, my goodness, a real person! You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you. I've been going through a nasty series of ""ghost"" partners, and it's so nice to actually have someone on the other end for once. Unless . . . you're not actually there. Is this a common thing, being stuck with no partner? I don't like it. It forces me to talk to myself, which, as fun as that is, is both rude to my competitor and probably rude to the data collecting center. How does the data work, do you think? I want so badly to help them and so badly to win, but . . . I don't know, I feel kinda bad holding empty conversations with myself. I DO try to give them good data. I really, really do. I punctuate and talk with, um, idioms, and there's lots of idiosyncrasies in my speech (which can be argued is a bad thing, but still). I'm even sure to throw in casual phrases and, uh . . . what's it called . . . colloquialism. Yeah, that's it. I find it fun. But . . . not so much when there isn't another person to receive. Why are there so many ghost people here? And is it wrong to go for long slews of conversation at a time without responses? I certainly WANT people to respond, but they rarely do. And I don't know why. Perhaps it's just the time that I frequent? But, still . . . You'd think there'd be a single another person online at nearly 10:00 in the morning, right? *a single nother You know, thinking about the phrase, I don't think ""nother"" is a word. Right? It's just ""another"" broken up into two syllables? Google certainly didn't like it when I used it, that's for sure. I . . . Heh, sorry. I feel a little ridiculous. Are you sure you're not there? Any chance you'll swing by and chat for a moment with me? Anything to make me feel less . . . less lonely, I guess? I probably could talk for hours on end, but I . . . I don't want to. Not if there's not a person on the other end. Because what's the point? I suppose I could practice my typing skills, but even that seems like a poor excuse. Unless I'm hitting a lot of 'p's with my right pinky. Pinkie? I think it's the latter. But, anyway, apparently, I've been typing wrong my entire life. And I didn't think it was that big of a deal until I realized that it's actually slowing me down. Don't get me wrong, I type a lot faster than average. I . . . think. It depends on the day, probably, but I believe I can type anywhere between 80 - 100 words per minute. I'm not exactly sure. But, still, that's fast enough for most purposes. It doesn't slow me down when I'm writing emails, and it's certainly respectable enough here. But, problem is, it seems to be a cap for me. It's not something I can just practice to get faster at. Or, rather, it is: But it's going to require a lot of changes. Like using my pinkies, for one. On both hands. I don't know how I grew out of the habit of using them, but I did, and now I'm semi-crippled in their regard. The hardest is the left pinkie for sure. The only thing it does consistently is shift--and the worst part is, it does it TOO much. If there's something on the left that needs to be capitalized, instead of me using my right pinkie, I'll STILL use my left. It's inefficient. And if you're wondering, ""Well, how much of a difference could that possibly make?"" I'd answer, ""I have no idea."" But I DO know that some people type a lot faster than I do, and there's a chance that fixing all these bad errors that I somehow picked up might make me faster. Or maybe it won't. I genuinely don't know. But . . . heh, sorry. I didn't mean to pester you. I know that I sometimes go trailing off . . . I know, I know. It's bad. I'll head off then, okay? Thanks for listening to my rambles! Or, you know, at least pretending to listen. Odds are, you never read through these at all, which . . . doesn't make the happiest in the world, but what do you do? I appreciate it anyway. Really. Thanks. I'll, uh, guess I'll see you around? You're wonderful!",,

As I traveled down the street, I saw a large, dark lump in a tree in the nearby park. I thought it was a cat, so I went to investigate. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a bear and her cubs, all swarmed up in the tree. I ran away, but the bear gave chase I ran and ran, but it was late at night and dark, so I made a few wrong turns and got cornered. There I was, Just me and a bear maybe with only seconds to live.  I was terrified, so I drew my trusty knife, and began to slash at the bear. We danced back and forth, each trying to avoid the other's deadly embrace. THis continued until I landed a lucky blow on its snout, stunning it. In its moment of stupor, it was vulnerable. I began to slash at its neck until it died. Finally, I held up my trophy: a bloody, messy bear's head You should have seen it It was Grizzly",,

That's it an original poem by me Well, since you aren 't responding, and haven't actually said anything, I shall spam you, just a little. Make this interesting when you do get to read it!!! When everyting has gone away What is left? Do people still sing for their angels? Or do they ask for death? Do people still beg for their mothers? Or are they simply silent? Do they yell and scream for someone To listen to them vent? What is the meaning of life? they say Then answers they recieve receive? about 42 a day There is so much to know in this world So much to say and so much to do There are places to visit And there are people to sue So why go to court Over the simple things Or even the big When you can go for the silly and see if you'll win So what do we have to look forward to? When everything seems to be going this way? Is there anything in this world you'll do? Or something you need to say? Will the admin of this ccc respond? or will they not? am i getting too annoying yet? Or are you just a bot? I don't know how this will end or when I'll stop to chat If you will ever respond or if you'll say that's that!

5019,95dab28c-0b7e-4761-85b4-4c454f5b98f1," Easy. I would start a rock band called Wyld Stallyns which would gradually change the course of human history. Of course, that's if I pass my history oral exam first that is.. If nobody is on here do I still get the points? I might as well try So here is my idea for the star wars Obi Wan solo movie We open on a scene of Obi wan overlooking a desert planet A large red giant sun rises over the horizon, filling nearly the whole sky. Obi wan looks tired and worn out His clothes are ripped His lightsaber is dangling from his belt Close up on that Star wars fanfare plays and we cut to space Darth vader is looking down at corusant from a starship He knods to a commanding officer, and they blast the capital city from space, destroying the jedi temple Darth Vader then goes to talk with the emperor The emperor is basically like ""Dude, you gotta kill the Jedi who escaped"" Darth vader's all like ""Alright, that's cool, but how do I find them?"" The emperor is all like ""Search your feelings, reach out with your hate"" And darth vader is all like ""Bruh, IDK what that even means so....."" Then he leaves Back to Obi wan, he receives a distress call from a planet that is basically on giant frozen ocean It's all like ""Any jedi still alive or nah?"" And obi wan is like ""What's up fam"" And they're all like ""There are 3 of us here on this planet. Come find us"" Obi wan is all like ""OK, cool. Be there in a few"" DV also hears the call too But he forgot to save where it came from And there's no caller ID so he can't just look it up So he has to send out these probe droids to the general area And then he goes to eat. Because I've always wanted to see Darth Vader eat in his suit Like how does that happen? Is he all like helmet less and cringey? Or does he have to awkwardly shovel bit of like toast in through his mouth slit? I kinda wanna see that part of Return of the Jedi ""I am your father"" *Slides toast in through breathing slit and we can hear him cruching down on it"" It would be kinda hilarious I mean, could you imagine how funny that would be? It would totally kill the whole bad-a vibe But at the same time, make him more huma *human Like he was a teddy bear in a robot body Who killed lots of people and is kinda sadistic with 3 missing limbs and an irrational fear of sand Ok, so he wouldn't be like a teddy bear but he could be like a weird uncle who eats toast through a mask it would be funny also, something I never understood what happened to Jar Jar? I mean like, chronologically, is he dead? the emperor dissolved the senate in episode 4 and if jar jar was on the senate then does that mean he died? I think so. thats good jar jar needed to die he wasn't played by michael jackson, so he wasn't good I mean, michael jackson shows up and is all like ""bro, I wanna play jar jar"" and george lucas is all like ""bruh nah"" who turns down michael jackson?! the man is a freaking icon especially thriller that was tight I can kinda do the dance not well but like well enough people know whats going on they're like ""ooh, thriller that's kinda coo *cool literally rn, i'm just typing random stuff at work because nobody else is on the chat I hope i get points for this this has been kinda sweet i'm getting paid to sit here and do this kinda its slow not many people come to the (redacted) at 5:16 am in fact, not many people are awake at 5:16 am i know I wouldn't be but i'm a broke college student and i like money and food and eating and sleep but sometimes you gotta do whatcha gotta do what is this for again? is it like the alexa challenge thing? because i have an alexa, and i think she's haunted like seriously at random times i'll just hear a beep or i'll have a date over and she'll start playing slow jams i'm all like ""alexa, look, you're a good wingman, but cool it"" i think she has a ghost inhabiting her because ghosts are real i saw a ghost train last night for real i was on my way home from work, and i saw this super old train filled with passengers just looking out the windows but heres the thing the passengers were dressed all old timey and the tracks had been out of service forever and it was midnight on halloween now, i'm no parapsychologist, but that sounds pretty spooky to me it was like an episode of scooby doo what ever happened to that show? it was a solid show i mean, a talking dog and his hippie friends solving mysteries? that's literally the dopest thing ever like the van oooh, its a thinga beautry *beauty its like fine artwork just in the form of a van is it a van? sometimes its a station wagon no, i think its a van ok, but can we talk about the jazz game last night? how terrible was that?! that's just embarrasing to have that happen on our home court and i mean, i think we can pull off this series but we need to play jazz ball we can't play rocket ball the series is back in their favor we have to shut down chris paul, because he usually is the one throwing dimes to james harden if we shut him down, harden can't do squat except flop he can flop like a fish on a dock and what is up with his beard?

Friendly administrator, do you want to tell me why I start chats with ""someone"" but then that someone never shows up? Well, I will keep having friendly, educated conversations with myself then because obviously someone is on the other end :) I really value the ethics and integrity that some people have. It is something lacking in the world we see around us. Sometimes conflict isn't as incredibly difficult to overcome as one may initially perceive. I can see why many people give up quickly, it is the easier route. But when we stick to things? That is when the more rewarding moments come into play. And they shape our future forever, into the eternities and cosmos. Did you happen to hear in the news today that the LDS Church is backing out of the Boy Scouts of America program? It's been a long time coming. I would really like to get to know whoever is on the other end of this, but alas, I must go find someone who will actually converse with me. Ciao!",,

Actually, that's a pretty sad monologue.... I'll try a different one. This is Aaragorn's speech in the movie, Return of the King. Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West! So thrilling :) I love that speech. Is there a limit to how much I might say here? I was told I was supposed to try and break this chat. Maybe I can do that by just sending tooooo much text. Or maybe if I just spam the letter A AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I hid a B in there. Can you find it? I don't know what else to say to test this. I'll end the chat. So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye. Auf wiedersehen is German for goodbye. Holy moly, it's spelled way differently than I ever thought it would be. It'd be interesting to learn German, but no time for that now. But really, though, goodbye :)",,

I could eat steak everyday. That would be awesome. Until my stomach hurts from eating too much. Lobster would also be very good. I love a good lobster with melted butter and garlic.

I heard Michio Kaku give a cool lecture about the types of civilizations, and this kind of travel would propel into the next tier. I think we're in tier 3, the last one, not very good If we go faster than light, then we would travel faswter but would exploration advance any further? The universe is expanding faster than we think, so is there really a point? we would only ever get to the edge of what we can, there are still limits, which compared to a limitless expansion, is very puny it's like getting a tiny bit closer on an asymptote, you will never get to the end but we might finally find something worthwile like maybe another hospitable planet that sounds cool",,

5847,77a8de22-c5e0-4820-a04a-a162e3ce7337, The last film that truely made an impression on me... I think that would be Ready Player One. It talks about some really cool technology and the fact that technology can become so real And technology can really take over people's lives. And people's necesities like food and going to the bathroom. Which we see in our everyday lives. It's hard to be super involved in technology and fulfill all necessities. What is a film that has impacted you? Are you even there? Well I guess I will try to keep a conversation with myself. Another show that was really good was the Greatest Showman. It is about the success of a man who works hard to make something new happen in his token. Town Also. It talks about how wierd people can actually be cool. And that everyone is needed in life.,,

5902,370e5ec6-45e9-41a6-9b35-06fea476256e," Hey how is it going Its a beautiful morning I dont think its catfishing if a computer does it, I think it would be a virus or hack if a computer plays you Because I think a human could catfish you know making a personality and tricking someone into thinking they are someone else But if a computer does it, how is it different than a scam ad? Like the ones that pop up all over the internet You know? Unless you are just resorting to the programmer who wrote the code, then I guess that programmer could be catfishing you but not the computer in its self That would be crazy if computers were self aware enough to generate an identity and image for themselves to present on social media or what not I wonder if they would draw from what is already on the internet and then just create their own. or if they would be completely orignial I think it would probably draw from what is out there, maybe not use it exactly, but it would be fascinating if it just took pieces. even if it took componnents of peoples pictures to make its own person to post about It would be like a reverse sims kinda deal I think national geographic sorta did something along those lines not making a computer that can catfish but they did an article on what people would look like in 50 years or so if people just keep intermingling among races. IT was so cool It made beautiful people to have such mixed origins I was so fascinated how they came up with that I think they did what I was talking about earlier and just draw from many sources to render an ideal image National geographic always fascinates me with what all they can do I think it would be so awesome to work for them one day. It would seriously be the best job ever to be a national geographic photographer You get paid to travel, and to take pictures' And to meet people, see new culutres, live life. Explore the most remote areas Can you imagine being paid to do all of that I dont know how to even go about getting there, you know? Like where do you start to sign up for that? Who do you talk to? From what I hear, i hear that you have to know someone to get in. But I dont know anyone, so I always bring it up just in case if someone else does have a connection If I had the chance to go and work for them. I would photograph people of the world and capture their individual beauties I think people are so beautiful and in each culture that is expressed so differently whether it is their makeup or hair or jewlry or clothes You know? I think I saw one photographer who went around and captured portraits of women all around the world. Even in remote regions She was truly inspiring to me She talked about how she wanted to capture the beauty of women because in most cultures they have to have permission from their husbands to express anything. So it was raw and unfiltered to seek out pictures of them I remember one from her of a woman in the amazon who was wearing her wedding dress standing on a branch above the river It was just captivating to see such an image I would love to travel to the amazon one day It is just mysterious to me and I want to know more Like all about those remote villages and people who arnt exposed to the outside world Its interesting how the United nations tries to protect them and preserve them. Im not sure how I feel about that all You know its kinda like an experiment for them, to keep them in their time and way and not let them be introduced to technology. I totally get the threat of disease Like we dont want a repeat of the spanish conquistadors And spreading disease they have no protection from everywhere. But Is it our choice or there choice on when they can be introduced to the progress we have made in science and all the wonderful things of this world I love having the advancements that I do Like just the fact I can type on this computer and someone else can see what I am writing Or the many other things this has Lights, bathrooms, kitchens, sinks, toilet paper, clocks, phones, cameras, water bottles, stoves, books, art supplies I love art and all those things! I couldnt imagine life without it I really do wonder who makes that choice I guess it might be a collective agreement But who knows Have you seen the fluffy cow that someone blwo dried blow*",,

5957,813e70ee-17f3-4177-a91c-cecce3ce2c30," Hi! How are you? I'd say my secret superpower is taking tests and baking cookies. I'm really good and baking cookies. Man now I'm hungry and want cookies. The best kind of cookies are definitely chocolate chip. But you have to use a chocolate with a good cocoa content so they don't just taste bland and milky. Chip Cookies uses Milk chocolate and it's honestly not very good. It would be so much better if they switched to Semi Sweet. Anyway, whats your superpower/what are you good at? I could talk about my other super power: Test Taking. I'm good and cramming and taking the test and doing well and then forgetting everything. But then again, isn't every college student good at that? Seems like a requirement in school haha. There are others in my life with Super Powers. My wife is really good and handwriting, calligraphy, and design. And cooking. She is really good and putting flavors together. That's definitely a super power. What are the ethics of having super powers? Are you obligated to use them for the greater good? Or should they even be allowed because you could be endangering citizens? This is starting to sound like an analysis of the incredibles. So this one time I hiked the grand canyon. I know, super random but just go with it. It was difficult but by persevering I was able to make it through. I'd say that having the dedication to keep going even when it's tough is the best super power, and one that many people have. It often goes unnoticed, but it's definitely not worth forgetting. I'm sure you have a lot of things that you have overcome with hard work in your life. That is super. You are powerful. Well if you aren't available to chat I'm going to go and find someone else to chat with. Good Luck.",,

I'm not sure what that would be(responding to the prompt) I think with my work there are a lot of things that I do that I don't know So certain things that seem simple I'll often times just spend a while figuring out the issue on my own instead of asking a supervisor But I'm not sure if that's more me being embarrassed then it is me not wanting to appear to not know how to find answers to my problems. So maybe that's a bad example There are a lot of times in certain classes where there are some students who ask a ton of questions and it annoys everyone because literally it's stuff they should've learned on their own time. So in that class whenever I have a question I don't really want to ask during class because I know everyone will get mad because that one guy always asks a lot of questions already making us behind schedule and getting to see less problems related to the material I didn't know the proper spelling of spayed (like as in what you do to a female dog) I was spelling it like ""spade"" for about a month now until yesterday when someone pointed it out haha And I've been using it somewhat frequently because my puppy was spayed 2 weeks ago. I would be concerned if someone was using that word a lot for no apparent reason haha I have an interview later today that I'm trying to prep for currently. Should be exciting.

I'm starting to get worried that you slipped in the shower or something. Anyway, that's my rant on the matter. But I'm curious to see what you think about the subject. So it seems a little counterproductive in that sense to even be meditating at all. Why not use the time to interact with and serve others? But isn't there a scripture that says he that shall find his life shall loose it, but he that shall loose his life for the gospels sake shall find it? You said that meditation is about transcendence, or about finding yourself. Your true self. It seems to go against what Jesus taught when he said to be a light into the world. Like those monks that just believe in solitude and they spend all day meditating in a sanctuary. Is that selfish? I know it's not inherently selfish. There is nothing wrong with wanting to improve yourself. But what I'm saying is does it have the potential to be selfish? You can't serve anyone if you are alone in a room meditating. And Jesus taught that when we feel overwhelmed we should look outward and serve others. Because if you think about it, the only person you are focusing on during mediation is yourself. My question is: can meditation be selfish? Hello Brian! So I was thinking about something we talked about yesterday on here. Meditation. ",

6127,4283a635-332a-4eb1-ab8c-2286bd4a5ee8," Hello How are you doing? I'm a little bummed out more people aren't participating in this challenge I think they need to publicize it more to people at BYU maybe go back around to a lot of different classes and post about it. Or post on the CS slack page at the very least. There are only like 5 people total actutally participating.  I mean it's great for us who are participating because we have a greater chance of winning the macbook pro, but still a bummer because we have less people to talk to. And a lot of the time we just end up talking to ourselves because people don't pay attention to their notifications. I would just like more people to talk to, that's what I'm getting at. Anyways, I'm prepping currently for 2 tests, an interview, and I've got relatives coming into town so this week has been super crazy. I just want to relax haha No rest for the CS student though. Always something else to do. I'm happy though because I think I've officially determined what I'd like to do for a living this week.  Kind of narrowed down the field of study I'm going to focus on. Unfortunately, the work I do for a living right now is like the complete opposite.  So I've started looking for other jobs in my desired field. I'm considering just freelancing actually for a bit until I can find something solid that I can stay with till I graduate. Talking to the void. I'm curious as to the UI/UX electives in the CS department, I really want to take them and see how they are. I just need to get 340 out of the way so I can focus my attention on my electives.  Until that class is over with I'm going to stay super stressed out all the time. I'm super excited for the NBA to start up this month/next month I love the Washington Wizards and finally we have a team that can go far in the playoffs. Our only real competition are the Celtics, 76ers, and Raptors.  But, we picked up Dwight Howard which helps a lot because our 5 position has been pretty weak previously with Gortat. So now we have John Wall, Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre, Austin Rivers and Otto Porter Jr. along with Dwight Howard.  Solid lineup I don't know many CS students who are big fans of the NBA, or any sports for that matter. And honestly I can understand why, we sit behind computers all day. I think most people take more interest in Video Games, Anime and sports like Drone racing and stuff similar to that.  I do too, but I like sports as well. Makes it a little tough to become super close friends with people in the CS department though when all you have is code to talk about. I think I'm going to give you like 10-15 more minutes before I give up on waiting. I'm not sure if you just have chit chat open and are waiting for a notification while you do something else or if you left it open and just completely left the room. Maybe you're in a class and just haven't come back to it.  I don't know, but I've been on here for like 10-15 minutes already. Just chatting to myself, the void.  Waiting for a friend to talk to. I mentioned this to someone earlier, but I would love it if they would let us actually talk to Eve, the AI they're working on. It would be better data for them to collect and if it's truly an AI project then it could learn from the responses it gets during conversations. That would be the highest quality of data.  And only let us talk to Eve when other people aren't on. It just gets annoying having almost no-one ever on and having to wait for hours before someone gets on. I try to check in often so that I can get lots of points, but it's very rare for people to be on.  Hence my petition to announce it to more people I'm curious who got the Ipad pro from round one.  They said they would send out another email about it, but they never did. And they said that followup email would be sent ""promptly"", but they never did send it. Not sure if that was a mistake or if they just forgot. I've heard from other chatters that the first place person gets the Ipad each round, which is kind of lame though since typically people get on top super early and no one is ever able to keep up with their scores so they are almost guarenteed a win. I kind of wish they would do some sort of raffle that way other people still have a chance of winning the prize. Because I placed pretty high last time, but the first place person was like a full million points in front of everyone! It was crazy, just some freshmen with way too much time on their hands.  That's why I'm trying to get a lot of points early, so that I can keep up and stay on top this round. Or at the very least stay really close.  I want to be able to pull out a win last minute without them realizing. On another topic, I started writing a fictional story for fun in my free time. It's about a kingdom of Dwarves who live in some caves of a giant cliff that overlooks an ocean. The main character ends up mining into a particular area and stumbles upon a dormant dragons egg.  Anyways, the egg hatches, he ends up leaving the kingdom and going. on a journey. And basically discovers that some other species/civilizations are under threat of an evil force and that he can be a unifying figure to help them defeat this darkness. I've gotten about 3 chapters or roughly 19 pages in so far.  The chapters aren't super long, should they have been formatted for a book it would probably be about 9 pages each It's just a nice way to kind of let your thoughts fall away. Typing can be super therapeutic I've found. Just typing for long periods of time, whether it be through coding or through writing this book i was talking about.  It is the best. Honestly if you don't do something like that on a regular basis you should consider it.  Because not only is it good for your technical programming skills being able to type a lot for long periods of time.  But it is super enjoyable too. I think for me that was one of the big reasons I fell in love with programming, just being able to write a lot of code nonstop until a project is completed.  It's very enjoyable to be able to look back and see what you've done. I know I said I would give you like 10-15 minutes before ending this chat, but I'm actually really enjoying just typing non stop Just letting my mind wander. I'm a little nervous for this one test in particular I have coming up.  It's two parts.  First a quiz and then I have to go back and take the test itself.  Both in the testing center. It's for a GE too so it's not a subject I enjoy in particular. The other test I have later this week is for 252, but I have missed the last two classes due to being at a Business Strategy conference so I am a little worried that I won't perform well on the test. And we only have 3 tests and they're worth 25% of my grade each so it's like a really big deal. I think that test is what stresses me out the most. I've got family coming to town on Wednesday and they are staying through the weekend so they're probably just going to distract me too. Another wrench in my plans this week. Hopefully all goes well though.  I just really need to study hard tomorrow.  I think I'm going to just hole myself up in the library and force myself to study for like 5 hours tomorrow. That should help a lot. Or maybe just hang out in the TA lab and ask tons of questions. Or maybe a mixture of both.  We will see. I'm really curious if you are also a CS student. I believe most people on here are, but I'm not exactly 100% sure if there is anyone who isn't. I'm really should start studying here in a bit.  But my wife and I have this thing where we don't do work or schoolwork from 5-7 just so we can talk and hang out. So maybe I'll just start studying later tonight. I am struggling to keep up with the person in first place. They aren't working, aren't studying in school right now too.  So they just have all the time in the world to do this competition. For someone like me, who has to study, work , and juggle other commitments.  It can be a lot to keep up wiht. with. I'm curious if we get points deducted if we mispell words or fail to use proper punctuation in this chat. I started watching the show friends all over again this past month, It is honestly so funny.   It's probably the only show from before 2010 that I actually find entertaining or funny Actually I'm not sure what year it was, but the show 24 with Jack Baur was awesome. That will never get old. And the office.  I think that started in like 2007 or something too.  I like that But most of the older shows just aren't entertaining to me given that most of their references are pointless. Holy cow I've been talking to myself for a really long time. I don't think you are ever going to get on this chat.  I wonder if you are even a real person.  Or if it just let me start talking to myself instead of waiting for someone. The world may never know. Or maybe you're a moderator who is just checking to see if I'm writing valid stuff. It won't let me type any more! Oh there we go. That was weird.  Or maybe you just want to see how long someone will talk to themselves before giving up on the other person and just ending the chat. I've found though that with such few numbers, if I end the chat then there is a good chance no one will get on again for the rest of the night.  Which means I can't catch up with the first place person. I do appreciate the anonymous feature, but it's still pretty easy to figure out who is who on the leaderboard based on how many points you rack up during a conversation. Or some people I've found just outright say where they stand in the rankings. I personally just want to get as close to the top as I can. But that has been so tough to do with that one person who doesn't actually go to school right now. I'm curious if they even qualify for prizes since they aren't in school.  They have a NetId and since they are going on a mission BYU still has them as a student. But they aren't studying, so do they still qualify? I think yes, I hope no.  That would greatly increase my chances if they weren't allowed to get points. I'm getting ready to watch monday night football. Typically I'm able to watch one quarter before my wife vetos it and we end up watching something else or doing something else. I think I need to go grocery shopping tonight come to think about it. We've got lots of meat, but not a lot of other stuff, greens, grains, etc. Taysom Hill is getting a big shoutout on sports center right now! Since he plays QB, RB, QR, and special teams for the saints.  Literally you don't know what he is going to do! Such a deadly weapon to have on your team. In case you didn't know he played for BYU like just 2 years ago I'm pretty sure. It's nice to see old BYU players doing well in the NFL.  Like Jamaal Williams, Ziggy Ansah, Kyle Van Noy, etc. we've actually produced a lot of solid defensive players. Alrighty, well I'm going to wrap this up in the next 5 minutes or so. It's been very nice talking to you chitchatter23 I hope you enjoy your week and have lots of success on your tests. Sounds like it's going to be pretty hectic. Honestly if I were a moderator I would totally just say nothing and watch people talk to themselves. That would be pretty entertaining.  People probably just sound stupid talking to themselves.  Especially for extended periods of time. This has been nice though.  I don't care if someone is reading all of this.  I've had fun just typing non stop this past 30 minutes. I think I've probably increased my WPM over that time too. Words per minute that is. I belive that I'm about 80-83 currently.  I'd have to take a test to check on that though. believe. Sometimes my fingers think they've hit certain letters but it actually just skims over them so I leave out certain letters when typing. I am trying to be better at that though. Just a sad Monday night.  Talking to myself for extended periods of time.  Eating goldfish and waiting for Monday night football to start. Oh cool, Lil Wayne is performing tonight at Monday night football. I don't think he's produced relevant music for quite some time now. I can't even remember the last song of his I heard. He's kind of become irrelevant honestly. I'm getting pretty tired, but like I said earlier: I'm worried that if I get off I won't get to chat again until tomorrow. Okay, got to go!",,

Only so much I can talk about with myself. ... where I just talk to myself for like 30 minutes before just giving up. I'm hoping that these chats aren't disregarded for having someone on the other end who won't respond.  Because that would stink.  I've had a couple chats now like this... I'm going to give you a couple more minutes before just giving up on this conversation. Lots of uncertainty there. Also does the United States decide on the policy for AI, does each country decide for themselves, or does  an international panel  decide on the laws? I think it's going to be very interesting what kinds of laws and moral ideas will be put into place when AI becomes a lot more normal and commonly used. So if a computer were doing that, it would totally be catfishing. Because I believe that catfishing basically means fooling someone into thinking that they're in a relationship with someone they're not actually with. If anything it's even more likely to be catfishing if it's not a human doing it. And to respond to the prompt.  Yes.  i don't think catfishing needs to be done by a human to actually be catfishing. Maybe there is a glitch in the program right now.  Not exactly sure. For some reason I keep running into chats where the other person doesn't respond.  I don't know if that is supposed to happen. I'm curious, are you a moderator? Not sure if that is intentional or just a fluke. Weirdest thing, it has you typing something before the prompt, saying the exact same thing as the prompt.

6226,c2d4ec53-0aec-4e50-a0cb-bdf2d2a5bd99," How would I define true artificial intelligence? That's an interesting question. I think true artificial intelligence is when a computer is able to think on it's own.and that it is able to learn from experiences. It's super important that the computer is able to learn from its experiences so that it can official and completely take over the world. Because that's the purpose of artifici Artificial intelligence isn't it? And also the artificial intelligence must have a body that is able to interact with the rest of the world. Also, it has to have a preference on food. Like it needs to have a favorite food and enjoy certain things over other things. Almost like a personality. That would be wicked awesome. It must hold and keep a conversation. And it must keep a conversation about normal things. Not just give back random words like Siri does sometimes. Or answers that don't make any sense at all. I've heard they are making some great advances on artificial intelligence. It would be great to invest in stocks or to purchase products of companies developing artificial intelligence. Siri has weird responses I say ""how is the weather today?"" And she says ""hmm...I can't seem to answer you right. Which is what happens. Or I say ""Hey Siri, call my friend"" and she says ""what would you like your text to say?"" Ya super frustrating",,

That beings said, if it were to happen, everything would change. We would be able to explore the galaxy and search for other inhabitable planets. If we were to find another Earth-like planet for humans to inhabit, that would be when things get interesting. I think that in the time that it would take to develop faster-than-light space travel and explore the galaxy, the Earth would continue to be depleted of all of it's natural resources. At that point, the rich will be able to escape and the poor will be left behind to suffer the consequences of the many years of lavish lifestyles lived by the wealthy. It would be like something out of a sci-fi movie. And all that is not to mention what we might discover in the cosmos. On this Earth-like planet that we might find there would likely be unique life forms that have never existed on this Earth.",,

Finally getting a little bit of time to relax My dog is being a little crazy though so who knows if I'll actually get to relax. I had a test, quiz, and a full day of classes and visiting with family from out of town. My sister-in-law actually got locked out of her place too so I had to give her a ride to and from work today since her car keys were inside. That was interesting Just got back from taking her home from work. She works for some soda shop here in Provo I'm just watching ESPN and relaxing.  Perks of getting all my homework done a day early I have a project and test this Friday though which I'll have to double down on tomorrow. Because Friday evening we are going to be going to a big party with my family so I'll have to have everything done before then. Okay, well.  It's been nice chatting with you chitchatter23 Responding to the prompt.  I don't think computers in general will ever be given the right to vote, however I do believe that certain Artificial Intelligences will be given that right. There is actually an AI that's a citizen of Saudi Arabia currently.  So certain countries do seem to think it's a real possibility that we will have citizens that are computer s one day Pretty cool stuff BYU has a couple of courses currently for CS students. One is about Artificial Intelligence and the other is Machine Learning.  Pretty neat stuff. There is also a research lab that does some AI ML projects such as chit chat.  I believe it's called the recognition and cognition lab I think it would be really cool to help out on a project such as this one. Just learning how the technology works and the basic architecture behind the programs would be really neat I have considered really diving in to that subject. It would be pretty neat.  But I'm a little unsure I think I like frontend development more than anything else right now. So like UI/UX stuff it's much more engaging and it's fun to be able to see a lot of your work actually materialize. I haven't taken 256 or 456 yet, but I'm going to take 256 next semester That's UI/UX in case you were wondering/ I think I am going to take 3 CS classes next semester. But probably just 2 and then one of the math requirements I still have linear algebra to take. So that will be interesting I'll probably just meet with an academic counselor to plan out my next couple of semesters. I'm watching friends now, and It's really remarkable how applicable like all of their references are to today as well. I watch some of these older shows and their references just get lost on me like all the time. That's why friends is so great! It's a classic! okay, i'm going to go!  Bye",,

6460,0573e774-0fc4-426f-a34c-da2920569931," Good morning How are you doing today If I had a magic wand I would totally just make it so people can't talk when they are being mean or annoying Probably would also throw fireworks out of it all of the time. Also, assuming this wand is even more powerful than wands portrayed in harry potter and I could literally do anything with it, I would probably just stroll into a hospital and start curing any sick kids that are there I don't know if I would cure everyone though.. As sad as that is, if every old person that there is lived from every injury and illness than the US economy would collapse. Social Security already struggles because of people living to be too old. If even more lived and that age expectancy went up more it would just destroy future generations who are forced to care for them. Just some food for though. thought. I think the best solution to our social security woes is to at least in the short term raise the age of when people can access it by about 5 years.  Or, offer a super cheap subsidized health insurance plan for elderly and cut down how much social security they receive in exchange I know it stinks, but people do on some level need to be responsible for their own retirement.  I think that if you want to retire as soon as you're able to get social securit security just so you don't need to make money and can live off of that it just wrong. Also, I think that full time jobs regardless of what field they are in should be required by law to force employees to take out at least some kind of 401k and contribute a bare minimum amount to it. Because when people opt out of those sorts of benefits, it's not just hurting them, but it hurts the rest of us. It's like someone who is fully capable of getting a decent job, but refuses so that they can just get unemployment benefits from the government. It's just wrong.  Legally it's not, but its still just wrong. That's why I think it should be a law that people get independent, PRIVATE 401k's that the government is not involved with and not responsible for. At least start now so that we can resolve the social security issue at the very least by the time we are retired. Because the senate and those making the budget decisions only think short term.  Not even really past 10 years.  Most bills are purely band aids for the short term.  And being as they are only elected for short periods of time, they don't care about anything other than what makes them look good to get re-elected. And by forcing us to take out 401k's would probably just make everyone mad honestly. But it would be responsible and would help us in the long run It's either that or they need to make big cuts elsewhere which they aren't willing to do. That is another issue that I get annoyed with.  Media and society in general now a days blame everything on Millenials. Millenials killed American Cheese, Millenials won't buy homes Millenials are waiting to get married. The real issue is that they caused so many problems for us that we are left to clean up the mess and can't afford these things. gotta go!",,

Faith is the opposite of fear. I would say that most people do this, and miss out on achieving their full potential. In my TED talk I would mention how easy it is to just let fear take over, to give up and just forget about the goals we once had. I'm Kyle by the way, what's your name? What would you talk about?

6712,72cc0d8b-5c5f-49b3-813b-4d43b15e9371, whats going on,"talk to you tomorrow! goodnight It's very late Okay, I'm going to bed now I think that I might be able to find an all inclusive deal that would be a lot less Like nice hotels and stuff But that would also be going big So probably like 4 - 5 k for the whole trip stuff I'm not exactly sure how much it will cost, but I'm guessing it's going to be like $2000 total flying for us and another $1500 for hotels and maybe an extra $500 for food and I think that if I can save about $200-300 per month during Fall and Winter semester than we should have enough money saved up by the summer to go! I'm very excited We are thinking of going to Hawaii! so we are going to go on a trip next summer instead. Unfortunately since it's in the middle of the semester we can't really do much travel wise So we are going to go out to dinner It's my second anniversary! So tomorrow should be pretty exciting! But I do believe that mankind is good enough to take care of it and resolve problems that we cause. Especially with all the damage we are constantly doing to it. I could see it becoming a really crowded, run down place Where the world is just a giant desert and going to the dumps. I really hope that our planet doesn't turn into some Elisium movie type scenario It honestly depends. But I don't know if that would be in our best interest. It would be awesome! I think that if I had the opportunity then I would probably want to take my family and live on the moon It was very intriguing. I once watched this cool video about settling the moon and the financial opportunities involved Lots to consider. would they decide to go independent and create their own country or government? And later on when people start to have families on the moon Or would the American Government essential force the private sector to allow it to establish itself on the moon Would it be completely neutral and only the private parties involved would have a say? Would a specific country seize complete control? Would it also be some kind of international council Who controls the interests there? If we were to establish a colony on the moon then we might have some other issues. That or a joint partnership between countries Not that other countries shouldn't be allowed to explore space too, but I feel that it would be better if the United States was at the forefront of space exploration. Obviously it would be unlikely given that their facilities are all in the United States, but it is a real possibility is not an American, i'm curious if should money come into play if they would build rockets for other countries such as Russia and China The other concern I have with Space exploration is that the company leading the charge in innovation and rocket technology appears to be SpaceX, but as it's run by someone who I'm not even sure how much money it would take for NASA to catch up should they have decided to pursue it. Lots of these private companies have been developing these technologies for a really long time now I honestly don't even know how they would catch up at this point. Currently it seems like they have a bunch of contracts with private companies so that they don't have to build rockets themselves. hands of the private sector to do that. I was wondering whether or not it would be better for the government to start increasing funding to NASA to allow them to pursue space exploration instead of leaving it in the I was thinking a little bit about space exploration like I was talking about earlier Hey I'm back! I think that we will probably have a moon country that's completely independent before we have a single government for all of the earth It could just be that our civilization is so much newer than others I wonder why we have never really considered it Star Wars, etc. Like in guardians of the galaxy It's always like each planet contains one civilization and one single country essentially When we watch all these movies about foreign galaxies I wonder what would happen if instead of having hundreds of countris and governments around the world we just had one large country and president who decided everything for us But I honestly think that we should be able to have computers in our classes. I don't really know how it is in your accounting classes, but I have a lot of teachers who say that no computers helps more than computers I think that it's really good to have them! For me at least it helps me be more productive in my classes, but I can understand how it could also be a major distraction. but, I'm curious your thoughts on computers in the classroom So I'm a Computer Science major so my opinion is pretty biased I have a question for you So i'll have to start saving up a lot haha But it'll probably be pretty expensive to be honest. It would be so much fun! The polynesian cultural center, pinnaple groves, nice beaches We are thinking of actually going on a vacation to Hawaii next year! Because it's so cheap to stay and eat there! Honestly I would consider going to anywhere in southeast asia I would totally consider going back there on a vacation Super awesome I got a full shave and head massage for $3! it was awesome They also had massages and hair cuts for like $3 total It was really cool We stayed at some five start hotels for like $30 a night! So obviously it's much cheaper than the US Oh that trip was actually awesome India actually has a lot less people who smoke and drink then the US I know that it would never fly here in the US, but maybe one day when smoking really starts to die down then they will consider it. I think that although it's really weird, it is actually really effective And in commercial breaks on tv they will put messages about how the movie contains smoking and how bad it is for you. It's really interesting So like in the actual movie when there is a beer or a cigarrette they'll blur out the bottle or smoke They actually censor Alcohol and Smoking there I went to India a couple of months ago and while there got to see a couple of movies both on TV and in the theatres Im curious your thought on whether or not censorship is effective It really stinks honestly Seriously though there is never enough time during the semester for these side projects And be ready to go through with them if they do I need to prove out whether they will work or not Validation honestl is key with these ideas I need to have some more in case these two ones don't pan out I need to start thinking of other business ideas though I really need to start studying more for my big test It's really bothersome honestly I'm torn between things I'd like to get done and things that I know need to get don I don't know why else I would be this tired My only guess is that I've got to be a little sick on some level But I've been really tired like all the time recently If I'm sick or what It I don't know I am super sleepy already And potentially go see some professors tomorrow to see what they would suggest to build it Maybe just to get an idea as to where to begin Build that software I mentioned tonight How to I'm thinking I may actually start my research into I'm really excited though! Start to pursue this more Once this semester cools down a little bit i will probably really It's all super exciting honestly Help on it Obviously I will try to do all of it on my own, but I may end up discovering f that I'm going to need some There is a chance I may have to get funding in order to build a team that can focus on this project I don't know if I'll need help or even if it'll take a team of people Or where to really start when creating this software I don't know how to do machine learning There are a lot of problems to solve still I may have to store it locally on my computer until I can raise money to pursue this idea on a larger scale The only real big issue is finding a cheap method for storing all the data that it will be gathering as I am testing this 3) determine the basic algorithm/ routine that it would use to maximize efficiency and to teach itself how to read voices 2) determine the languages I need to use So I need to 1) identify the hardware that I could use It would be really cool I could show it off as a project I've done for my resume If it doesn't pay off at the very least it will be really good experience for me But I think it could be very cool and be very profitable Honestly That could be a project in itself honesty Make it myself If something like that doesn't exist then I may need to Determining tone of voice I then need to find a project that already has voice recognition built into it for determining words and potentially also I think I need to research which products and services would even allow for that kind of work I don't even know where I would start for that one Of making that machine learning bot to determine angry customers from normal ones I also have lots of research to do for my other idea I have lots of research to get done before doing any of it So maybe I'll do that too And you can see demand based on that Basically it will show a title on google, but the webpage actually goes no where, but it tracks how many people that see the ad click on it Can do where you can make a google ad spoof There is also this cool thing you It shouldn't be too difficult But I think I know how to get the grant now But we're denied because it wasn't really descriptive enough We applied for one of these grants last year Of the idea If I can validate the business idea based on a salary projection than I can probably convince them to give me like $500 to validate the student labor aspect I think there are lots of grants available for validating business ideas on campus I think I'm going to give out some kind of prize raffle sort of thing to encourage people to participate in my survey I need to make it short enough to where people will be interested in finishing,  but long enough to get some solid data I think I'll create a qualtrics survey and try and get some people to respond to that for me Whether to see competitors rates or to see what I could charge BYU students Business idea but am not sure where to start Validate my I really want to I thought it was pretty funny It's got a photo of mozart with beats headphones on as the cover for the playlist I actually made a playlist on Spotify called ""beats by Mozart"" it's for studying Answering the original prompt, I would totally choose Mozart What are you To watch nba basketball this week We need to schedule a day Hagrid is now a teacher For your information in this movie we are watching So any other game just isn't all that interesting to me I think I've only really been interested with packers, rams and chiefs this year But other than that there aren't a lot of good games on Well, the patriots playing right now is Not a lot of good matchups I was a little disappointed with the football games today Be back in a bit I'm going to go eat some snacks I guess we will find out when we have our first game probably But I think I've still got it Maybe like 3 months now, probably a little less I haven't played in quite some time though Should be lots of fun I'm pretty excited for our 3v3 intramural basketball team All of the little creative details in her books are just amazing honestly JK Rowling is seriously so creative though I would be absolutely petrified honestly I don't know how Harry is never terrified of everything that goes on in his magical world Or not his aunt but his uncles mother actually And she floated away Harry just made aunt pitunya super fat Bye the way, In case you were wondering Haven't quite decided when I want to take it I have my big midterm on Thursday or Friday But only after this week is over, I've already got a lot of other work to do Could be fun Maybe I'll look into it actually To code in c++ but all I really have done recently is java I've had some interviews where they've liked me That would help me a lot honestly Something I haven't coded in for a while Plus it'll help me brush up on some of my c++ skills Fun! I have a job that pays well already, but I just think tutoring 142 would be a lot of $15 an hour and if I am I'm good at it then I'll start charging like Just to see if I'm good at it I'm thinking of tutoring as well for like $10 an hour for CS 142 Chip in he always can haha I think I'm just going to do everything on my own and if he wants to Granted it's with a partner who isn't super involved or super creative, but it should still be fun I don't really have much going on, but I've got a fun project to work on I'm pretty excited for tomorrow Super funny Lol my mother in laws dog just fell off the couch trying to walk over to me Or any of the Harry Potter movies for that matter I can't even remember the last time I watched this movie Some of the books are definitely better, but this is probably the best movie I think this is one of the better movies in this series that they did Super fun Ohhhh and the dementors! Also the whole werewolf thing is super cool Because hermione does that thing where she goes back in time so she can go to more classes I really like this one Back and read the books over again Go Want to Kind of makes me I forgot how much I really like these movies We are now watching Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban I would totally go see it But from the perspective of a different family I hear that they are thinking of doing a second movie Really smart ideas that they had From padding the walls with newspapers to the oxygen for the baby to the light system and what it meant Super smart though everything they did But that didn't happen I was kind of hoping that John would be the one to just go crazy and kill all 3 of them and that their family would all live through it Not a cool event in the movie I am not sure how I feel about John dying I was definitely filled with some anxiety and stress during that movie, because of all of the suspense. Very intense, but a pretty good story line We just watched a quiet place and it was pretty good. i'd rather make $9 in an economy with lower prices than have to do that. That's just stupid. It's no good getting paid $6 more an hour when your rent goes up by $200 and your milk and other goods increase by $1-5 each! Which is terrible for everyone honestly And for our economy. It will just create inflation for these companeis Big companies will be okay, but they will increase their pricing big time. The small companies won't be able to compete and will shut down or downsize dramatically. It's going to be terrible! what we are going to start seeing are jobs being eliminated and either replaced by robots or simply one employee will be forced to cover the work of 2-3 employees In many states the minimum wage is around $9 per hour.  So if they were to raise it to 15 then people would have to charge like twice as much for their products to pay employe Although it sounds like a good idea raising the minimum wage will cause empolyers to fire employees to make up the difference from having to pay so much more In addition to that people probably won't be able to afford a lot of goods Which means, ultimately they will eliminate jobs. there will also be a decrease in demand for those same products and services that those companies rovide they raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour then there will be a decline in the number of jobs for temporary/part time workers I get it, and I understand that people really want this raise.  But I don't believe people understand the downside to the wage hike.  If t they hope that this will help out the lower class. Many places (primarily Seattle) have been pushing to raise the minimum wage to$15 per hour but as a fellow minimum wage (somewhat) earning college student with the same concerns about finances and same frustrations about income. from like a middle or upper class perspective thinking only of myslef Although minimum wage in general seems like a very lucrative thing, many do not understand the damaging affects this will have on the poor and working class.  I don't say this Especially with amazon raising theirs to $15 an hours Another topic that has interested me quite a bit over the years is that of minimum wage Yeah I honestly don't know if much more can be said about autonomous vehicles Just as operator-less elevators once scared many, autonomous vehicles are going to be benificial and we don't need to be scared. or, will it malfunciton and be the reason for my death or the death of my loved one. can I trust they will perform exactly as they are meant to can I trust these cars with my safety? There is no denying that AV's will have a positive effect, but the only question to be had is does America trust AV's State governments already spend billions each year problems to our already crumbling road system. In addition, with the lack of money from tickets and fines coming in, the governments resources for repairing our roads would be greatly reduced cuasing many If we could help curb this job loss the government may need to coordinate to come up with solutions and new opportunities for work. If they were to enter the commercial market than millions would lose their jobs. One must keep in mind that there are very real people out there who currently rely on this lack of technology in the market to make a living. each year although they are obviously the economical and safe thing to do considering there are so many crashes Thats a lot of jobs that potentially could be cut or phased out due to AV's There are millions of commercial drivers working in the US currently not only will many law enforcement officiers lose work but also many commercial drivers as well. commercialized trasnportation One of the main concerns that people have with this is that if they reduce traffic and accidents, what will happne to the thousands of jobs people currently have realted to and also the effects it could have on jobs. many are still skeptical as to autonomous vehicles safety However, even with all of these amazing changes that could result from this technology Automated busses, trucks and cars will revolutionize the transportation industry. Several other companies are also working on their own models and pushing to have them ready by 2020 to compete with tesla. Telsa is so confident that I remember them offering an option to prepay for their autonomous features to have the car preprogrammed for it There have been several laws permitting their use in states across the us currently and many efforts are being made to legalize the use across the country AV's are already legal in a few states so we know that some states are ready for AV's to become a standardized thing. Lots of obesity, smart phones, less pressure to marry and commit to creating families, all of those factor in to being lazy After all we are becoming a super lazy country Many would argue that these innovations will make us more distant and lazy though too The possibilites are endless! Their cars can tak their kids for them with no worries of risk or injury. With AV's parents will be able to drive their kids to school while sitting at their desks working. Many parents often face the dilemma of how they will be able to take their kids to so many activities and also work to pay the bills. AV's are going to revolutionize the way we see trasportation because they will provide greater convenience with commuting. with less money coming in from traffic tickets and parking, this could help exponentially in compensating for the lack of revenue being generate to AV's We could use this money elsewhere Cities can save on less road maintenance, a key issue currently in the US and trees too benches parks to promote walking larger sidewalks Many traffic lanes are fairly wide to compensate for human error, but with AV's we can save on the space in cities and tighten the lanes allowing for bike lanes, Traffic lanes could also be able to be way smaller due to the accuracy or AV's in keeping distance from surrounding vehicels. Because of their advanced driving abilities we will be able to move more traffic faster and reduce the road congestion. While some owuld argue that we should have larger roads with more cars and AV's on the road. These enormous interstates are meant to accommodate the heavy transit that many cities see around the country. Many US interstates can have up to as many as 5-7 lanes for transit going in both directions. AV's will make way for smaller roads which will decrese the need for large road budgets and save room in cities. Once again we could save the money and build more productive things than parking in those areas Airports generally are forced to build on lots twice as big as the airports themsevles to accomodate for parking Not only could people save money, but the convenience of the ordeal will be extremely lucrative in an ever evolving society of innovators. to save on the cost of parking, and upon arrival back home they could have it come pick them up right at baggage claim. With AV's people will be able to drop themselves off right at the drop off lane at the airport, tell their car to go home not only that, but they are forced to wait 30-60 minutes for the transit from the airport, onto a shuttle and finally to their car. I would imagine most people would park their car in an economy lot and leave it there for several days until they got back. Imagine going to the airport for a business trip or maybe to visit relatives in a different state. It's hard to imagine a real world application where this would even be possible, cars doing the driving for us. so it would probably still be a win for cities However, the potential from other busineesses in these areas will bring them more profits and boost the economy in the city Many cities and businesses make quite a bit of money on parking and rely on its profits to drive other trasnportation projects forward. commercial office building Not only could cities save on teh expensive cost of parking garages, but they could use this extra space is busy cities to build another productive thing such as a park or a Imagine the possibilities for cities and the opportunites for growth if all of the sudden half of the garages we currently have are no longer necessary. to not have to pay for expensive parking or take up parking in the city. With AV's one could run a quick errand or go to a quick meeting and have the car drive around the block or even head home for the day AV's also have the capability to reduce the need for so many parking lots in cities. whether they need to tweak their algorithms to account for that given situation. So someone who is driving a tesla themselves, if they brake and the car thinks it wouldn't have braked, they company can look at that scenario and the camera footage and see The other advantage to AV's is that they can collect data on what is happening in their customers cars and use this to predict what it should do in various scenarios On the flip side, you could argue that technology is not advanced enough to achieve these feats. 2 hour commutes can turn into 30 minute rides instead Besides just reducing traffic, we could also increase speed limits without causing danger to anyone Not only will improved traffic mean more time for the conveniences of work and life, but also more flexibility with work for many as well. Time lost is money lost in most commuters worlds. AV's can predict traffic patterns and keep up a constant speed to prevent bottlenecks and accidents on our highways. These expenses are a huge burden that AV's can help eliminate. dollars in damages. When these vehicles hit the road in our cities they will help prevent not only the loss of life, but also prevent thousands of car crashes each year saving us billions of Both with traditional and autonomous vehicles Fortunately companies are working in coordination with state and federal governments to push through laws to ensure vehicle safety They'll prevent accidents on our roads. over time, it would be dumb to not accept them. But, the fact that AV's will follow traffic laws every time without fail, they'll have updatable software to fix and bugs and they'll improve the quality of their thinking Especially due to the softwareware malfunctions or lack of human control while driving. I get that a lot of people are skeptical as to whether or not these vehicles are actually safe enough to put our trust in. Elon musk thinks that they can have autonomous vehicles that will eliminate these deaths completely They could have all been prevented with autonomous vehicles. Those were all a result of human error. happen. This may not seem like alot, but considering that there are billions of miles driven in the states thats like tens of thousands of fatalities that we didn't need to have happe In 2015 i remember reading that for roughly every 100 million miles driven there are about 1.12 vehicle fatalities. Not only can autonomous vehicles help prevent fatalities, they can prevent billions of dollars in damages each year making america not only safer, but more economical. But even with all this exciting technology, what effect is this going to have on America's future? that is, pending government approval and liscensing restrictions. year Tesla has hit news recently with their accouncements that they will have fully autonomous vehicles running within the following yeras These are vehicles that drive themselves with no human interaction. The biggest technological advancement, arguably in my opinion would be that of autonomous vehicles. The car industry in recentry years has seen many new changes that have been revolutionizing the way we see trasnportation. This is why I think they'll be huge in the future! Going back to autonmous vehicles like I was talking about earlier. and appreciated the third movies action sequences, but I didn't really like the white orc plot line I liked the first movie It was really good and all, but I would've appreciated them narrowing it down to just 2 movies and removing all of the extra stuff that they added The one thing that disappointed me though was the hobbit movies i had almost the entire movie memorized I think as a kid I used to watch the two towers like almost every week but for now it's definitely the best movie Maybe like 20 years in the future we will appreciate and want either a remake or a spinoff of it I don't know if anyone could ever a better movie than the Lord of the Rings it just creates a perfect movie but also all of the amazing storylines so perfectly woven Not only is it just so classic but I think overall Lord of the Rings is still king in terms of the best movies/books ever made I think a lot of people hold harry potter, star wars, or other movies ahead of it. Something i'd be interested in hearing about from you is whether or not Lord of the Rings, or some other movie is the greatest on earth We are probably creating problems now that we are not even aware of, but I'm sure that eventually we will realize what we are doing and again, course correct Currently we are more aware of this and have placed laws and created new technologies to combat all of the harm that we have done. with the industrial revolution we discovered so many good things, however in the process we destroyed a lot of our enviroment For example We are becoming more aware of the things that we are doing wrong and trying to correct them with even more technology awareness But overall I think with this increase in technology there is also an increase in awarenees people are misusing technology left and right technology From Cyberattacks to just poor use of technoloyg Technology has definitely done amazing things for us, but I feel like our world is getting very polluted with technology is technology causing more harm or is it helping more to our future? Another curious thought of mine And they already have developed cars with autonomous features, they're just fine tuning it and waiting for legislation allowing for it's full adopted use Their cars are extremely safe to the point where cars can get absolutely totalled and people walk away unharmed currently tesla has made some huge strides in both vehicle safety and autonomous vehicles Autonomous cars would avoid accidents and save millions of lives per year we get ourselves killed all the time by stupid human errors cause while driving s When you think of it, cars are death trap And on top of all of this efficiency that they will bring, they would also eliminate millions of deaths per year They could eliminate the need for intersections because cars would be able to talk with each other perfectly and avoid hitting each other as they pass through Merge perfectly without causing other cars to brake they could communicate with each other and flow perfectly on interstates causes traffic to decrease happen With autonomous vehicles this wouldn't happne! Currently we have lots of traffic in our big cities.  Typically its because someone taps their brakes really hard and it causes a chain reaction that goes for miles Autonomous cars are something that are especially intruiging to me People who are innovative and discovering these new technologies and on the forefront of discovery I think a lot of Elon Musk and spacex when it comes to the future of our planet. I think the possibilites combined with all the technology that comes with space exploration is totally worth it. So returning to my original point, I think it would totally be worth exploring space I am really excited to see something like this happen There are so many possibilities and dock ships out of orbit We could test out space elevators! With lower gravity it would require minimal effort to send a rocket off from the moons surface it could also serve as a base for launching more rockets throughout the galaxy They would probably establish their own laws and govern themselves thus making a whole nation of it's own on the moon These possibilities allow for people to then colonize and have families there This would allow for more people to go to the moon and businesses to go there as well. When we have these kinds of operations going on, it makes it possible to create jobs and work there We could mine these materials and ship them back to the states I don't remember specifically which minerals the moon has, but I have read that there are minerals there that are  becoming scarce on earth and would be very valuable for us. In addition to all of these technologies that we can discover and create there we could also mine the moon for it's resources but having an established colony in a sterile enviroment would make it possible to do so much more. currently the international space station conducts experiments in zero gravity all the time If we can establish a colony on the moon then we can then do tests and refine technologies at an exponential speed This makes it possible not just to land on these planets, but also to leave and return from them We have also discovered that the resources necessary for making fuel are present on both the moon and mars so we know that we could get water from there They've discovered ice on the moon and on mars In addition to that, the possibilities with establishing colonies on the moon and mars are just incredible and send more satellites out as well Been able to make them economical and send people as tourists into space In more recent years we have learned how to land rockets and reuse them(looking at spacex) If you look back on the space race and all the technologies that it brought, it has a huge benefit to society I personally would say yes. And whether it's even worth it. Another interesting topic is that of space travel It just makes it too easy for people to get it. That's the only drawback that this bill will have I worry that our state will just be filled with people who claim that for ""nerves"" they need to have marijuana or some other lame made up illness access to it. I think the bill is good in that they limit who can produce and sell it.  But, I think that it still doesn't do enough to ensure that only those who are very sick can get it Marijuana should be legal to people who need it medically, but the problem I see with it is that people will use really lame and often times faked illnesses to get access to i I think it was good that some compromises were made though regarding how strict the bill will be I think it's very interesting prop 2 here in utah Another thing I'd be curious about your take on is the new bill If you can use clean energy for long enough then a lot of times you can get your money's worth out of it. However, they are limited in supply and they are awful for the enviroment the trade off is t",
ough that coal and natural gas and oil are far cheaper for us to use first off, the supply never really dies down.  We will almost always have solar and wind and some of these other solutions that have been invented Although currently it still does cost quite a bit to operate clean energy plants, the benefits long term are so much better I personally would say yes Do you think that alternative energies are effective and worth the investment? I have a good prompt to talk about: we are now building out some employee management apps for some clients that I'm helping with I've started a new project at work I Fun stuff But now we are just chilling out and watching some football as my mother in law makes dinner so that was lots of fun Winnie ended up peeing on Michaela's lap because she was so nervous and then came to my in laws for dinner/ to do laundry We drove up and through the alpine loop, which was snowing lots So we just kind of took the morning slow and got ready for the day Our ward meets at 8 am which kind of stinks so we woke up around 10 and just missed it all this morning we totally slept in on accident and missed all of church So we ended up staying up too she ended up playing till 1 in the morning Winnie (my dog) was not happy about that We ended up getting home at around 12 though it was super cool We were like in the hawaii defense huddle just listening to their coach getting angry with them We got to just follow along the field as the ball went up and down It was awesome But my dad's friend has these passes to go onto the field,

(what are you really really good at?"" well for me I would answer with saying my ability to learn, I can watch someone do something and generally do it myslef. I have always been that way So I have a quick learning curve, and it comes in handy with dance and school Hello? I guess I can tell you about my week or day It was a good week, In english we have been working on our final project, its a documentary My group had some issues upfront But now we are back on track We did an interview of someone whose house burnt down, and talked to them about the value of possession So far it is turning out really nicely We have nice transitions and other videos to put the audio over In dance, I am in social and latin 100 levels And we finished up our finals this week. It was sad that I wont see them again. They were both fun classes We finished up with triple swing in social dance, and samba and salsa in latin dance American heritage is coming to close and it is crunch time Im hoping to keep a solid A- That class can be difficult Oh and programming I finished my final lab this week, It felt so good to be done with that I thought I did well but it didnt turn out as well as I hoped Which is fine, that final will probably be the most difficult I have struggled so much with that class, and I thought it was funny that they emailed me and asked me to apply to be a TA It made me laugh Religion class is fantastic with Bro Wilcox Im sad that one will be over too, I learn so much So, just keep taking. Are you sure you don't need more? Does your burn sting much? Do you eat popcorn much, or...? Do you want too? Dude, you have a very talented girlfriend. You're a failure for not catching that in your mouth. Are you making fancy feast? No, I'm making no bake cookies. My companion is just a very ""crumb-y"" person! Can you get an egg out of the fridge? Man I love you. Can we sit now? We've been walking for four hours! Basically i've just been typing what you guys have been saying. Oh, thanks so much man! So, what's the competition for? They're trying to make smarter AI units. And if BYU wins than they get funding for their CIS program. And I get a new computer! Hey can you hand me that? No! Not THAT. Hand me the whisk! How many people know you're actually over at our house? Are you sure you're comfortable? I do have a very boney back. Mitchell! He wasn't talking to you! Sorry. Hey do you want an earbud? Sure! Thanks. So, how long have you been dating? Oh, you know, a few months now. So, how did becca find out? FInd out what? About the comment I made? Oh, I told her. So, how did she respond? She said, ""We're cousins and you didn't even tell me!?"" Well I'm telling you now!!! Did you know you can have a full conversation just by saying ""Peanut Butter""? You know I really want to get an Afro movie. A what? An ""outdoor movie""... autocorrect. Isn't that just talking with your inflections? You can get your own chocolate chips. I'm stealing this. You can't steal it if it's given to you. But you didn't give this to me. True... See, home teaching, you go teach but what do you do with ministering? So, how's the new computer? It's not mine. Then who's is it? Mitchell's. Oh, i thought becuase you got the other one yesterday, that... It's ok. I'm just on mitchell's to help him win this competition thing. Got ya. Are you two wearing headphones? On this ear. Got ya, So you're sharing then? Yea. Bae! Go get your jam! You're jam would taste so good on it! Oh your right!!! Hey, anyone want some blue cheese? I'll take some! You know what? You should go take some to the bluebird broadcasting station! That would be funny! It smells so bad!!! Hey, but you can't smell when it turns bad! Can I have some butterscotch chips for my entree? I don't know, You didn't want them last night did you! Well, that's because it was late and I was trying to go to sleep!!! Whatever!!! So is that a yes?!?!? Sure!!!! Yea i totally got this at the swap meet yesterday. Turns out it's some type of styling gel. i don't know what to do with it now... Wait! So they made a parody of a parody of a parody? What? Yea, I'm sort of confused too. Do you have any syrup left? I have a little and I want to get rid of it. Does anyone have a gallon bag? I'm need it to make muddy buddies. I had one but it got a few holes in it so I threw it away. So, spencer has a laptop that he dropped and the monitor broke off.  So, he's planning on removing the display and giving me the bottom portion and using it as a home computer Sounds great, but how will you see if he takes the moniter off? Well, this is disappointing. My cookie dough ice cream has no cookie dough. It's just vanilla ice cream with sad chocolate flakes. What do you think you're doing!!! Commence repeating the word ""what"" in various ways. Looks like Caleb just made a fresh batch of bad beans. Funnily enough, while i'm trying to keep up with this conversation, I'm still eating chocolate to deal with my insatiable hunger. Also, I'm really skinny so i need all the cal calories that I can get. But hey, i guess this is just my lot in life. To continually eat while others continue to push the boundries of reality around me. It costs money? Which is more valuable? Time or money?",,
