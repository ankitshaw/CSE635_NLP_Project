I think it would be more common for sentient computers to get turned off, so it would be more dangerous for them If they were in robot form, I think it would be easier to see them as intelligent creations Another important part of this question deals with what would make a computer living I have hitherto assumed that the ""brain"" of the computer is the hard drive, or memory But I suppose it could be more obscure, such as processing power, or the processor itself Perhaps the computer wouldn't have memory at all It would just start anew each time it was turned on If that were the case, only destroying the computer would be akin to murder", Hi TJ how're you doing, That's a good point.

After all, the internet hasn't been around for that long Hmmmm...you know, this question is making me realize how heavily we as individuals and as society rely on the internet A lot of individuals would mourn the loss of social media A big chunk of politics occurrs on the internet, so lots of changes would have to happen there But not EVERYONE would be affected Those in third-world countries with very limited access to resources and information probably wouldn't take much of a hit I think the internet turning off indefinitely would cause a lot of people to reevaluate their priorities in life So there could be some positive consequences too I guess there's nobody else on this chat Darn We really could've chatted things UP!

But would people have more money if they didn't have the internet? Because they wouldn't make as many instant, easy purchases. It's an interesting question. Just think about it. What if people spent less because they didn't see as many ads on TV or on their phone? I know it wouldn't affect me much because I hate spending money without planning out the buy and thinking it over multiple times. Okay I think your internet really did stop because you haven't said anything in a really long time. What do you do to troubleshooting your internet?

603,603,a92c2876-7dde-465e-be5a-cc480a5c59e0," What would I do if I had a magic wand? What an interesting question I think I would write a movie. Just because that's hard and the wand would make it way easier. This movie would be about America and the constitution. It would talk about the struggles of the constitution and the difficulty to get it approved by all the delegates and all the states. Especially New York. Because they were very stubborn. It would also talk about the taxes made on commerce by the British and the fights that the Americans have with the British. It would also have to talk about avoiding corruption and how to do it. Government needs to be something that manages a series of different situations. George Washington would be a huge key in this movie I would want to make. And it would have to include various patriots like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton and Madison It would also need to include the fact that the king of England is very stubborn and doesn't budge. Who thinks that the Americans are still not part of a new country but of his own. One that still continues to tax American goods. Also, it would talk about the need for the government of the Articles of Confederation to be changed because it just isn't going to work out. It would talk about the constitution being ratified so narrowly. And it would talk about the need for unity between the states and a powerful enough central government. There will be rebellion in many places and it would show that under the Articles of Confederation the central government wasn't able to fight back. And so they would gather together and revise the articles of Confederation. But they actually end up throwing it away and changing it completely. And they use the state constitutions and results as test cases or examples of how to form the new government Also, the only way a convention would happen is if George Washington would show up which he didn't feel like showing up because he didn't want to have anymore lime light. I think Washington was just being dramatic because he was very much like that. George Washington loved theatre and so I think he was acting. I'm sure he also was just really tired from everything that was going on Forming a new government after a revolution would be very hard And if Washington didn't show up to the convention of 1787 things wouldn't work out. But thankfully he did come. In the end he decided to. And we find out later that it is very important that they have this convention and that is was successful even though it was so close to being a failure.", What Potatoes exist?? I didn't know This is news to me I am gay, That sounds like a very interesting movie. I would love to see it. I'm sure it would be very interesting.

Lots of various items hang from the hook, old and hardly used keys, lanyards, and you reach for a specific item and take it off Its a long red dog leash Fairly old, and looking like its been chewed up a fair amount As your hand lifts the leash from the cluttered hook, suddenly your thoughts are interuppted by an ecstatic golden retreiver bounding into the room You quicly clip on the leash to the dog's collar, and open your front door As you step outside you are greeted by the chill air, slowly getting warmer from the sluggish sun on the horizon You make sure to close and lock your door, and then head out, through the small, still asleep neoghborhood You go on a longer than usual walk, making sure to enjoy the silence and brisk air before it is gone for the day After nearly an entire hour of walking, you're nearly back to your house You notice a lot more people out and about now than when you left You make sure to wave to your three-house-down neoghbor Frank who is cutting his lawn.

As you get close to your house, you recognize someone coming from the opposit direction, you can tell its a girl, but you can't quite make out if you know her, however she Looks familiar, so you slow down a bit from your quick pace As you get closer, you recognize her It's your neighbor, Kinsley She's wearing a rather revealing outfit as she jogs, and your hesrt begins to beat faster As she gets closer, you smile and try your best to act casual. ""Should I finally ask her out"" you wonder, ""no, i can't do it"" As you near her, you steel yourself and decide to ask her out after all. You open your mouth to utter a casual greeting... Suddenly, before you can utter a word, a different voice cuts in. It's your dog, who has suddenly opened his mouth to utter a mere five words... ""Jack is a plane clapper"" Kinsley's face contorts into an expression of disgust and she quicly walks past you and hurries into her house You merely stand there, mouth hanging open in disbelief that your dog has once again ruined your chamce at a date.", wow I hope my dog never talks, That sounds like a lot of fun! I'm going to have to try that out. Thanks for the tip!

I would just be talking to any birds on the side of the street, any stray dogs and of course little bugs that are everywhere I would definitely be very happy because I adore animals and being able to effectively communicate with them would only make me like them even more Now I wonder if anyone is actually looking at these messages that I am posting Hi there!!!

727,727,101a744b-3fb2-4b8a-a866-25cf80a01a8c, Painting you like one of my french girls ;)," If money were no object.. I have gotten this prompt half a billion times. It's like every other prompt that I get. But if money were not an object, I would travel the world. Starting with going and visiting Europe. And then probably going to Asia. I think it would be cool to see France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece. You know. The typical ones. And then I could go visit Turkey and Bosnia and then head over to Asia. Then I could visit Nepal, Thailand, China and Japan. Those are all super cool countries. And it would not be a cheap trip because I would try all the foods of those cultures and countries. So this would probably take about 10 years to do depending on how long I want to stay in each country I would also have to go see different monuments and the typical touristy things. And I would need to do a lot of exercise so I dont get super fat. Obviously the food is the best part. Also I would probably want to take my brother or someone to have some company or else it would be very boring I think. So...what would you do? Where would you go? What would be the best part? Anything you would look forward to if you did a trip like the one that I described? Also, if you had all the money in the world, would you go on a trip around the world or would you do something else? Also, what is or favorite flavor of ice cream? I think chocolate mint is wicked good. And I would need to try all the types of food in Italy. Especially all the different types of pizza. Not just the plain pizzas but the really extravagant ones. And I would need to exercise a lot. Probably in all of the countries I'd be in, I would need a gym membership. I might also need security guards for some of the more dangerous countries around the world Also, they would need to be well trained just because you don't want some crazy guy as your security guard. They would probably be really buff guys. Maybe even Russians Maybe I hired them along the way on the trip. Also, what is your absolute favorite food? Oh! If I went to Spain I would eat all the Spanish food possible there. Fabada, cachopo, chorizo, paella, mariscos those are all super good types of food. Also, I would have to go the the Canary Islands and eat mojo and papas canarias And gofio with honey and milk. And drink clipper everyday for weeks while staying on the beach. There are a lot of hippies that live on the beaches there but I wouldn't do that. I would live in a hotel or an apartment. I would probably go and stay in Tenerife. That would be really cool. Or you could say wicked awesome too. Also, do you know why the fish is super expensive on the Canary Islands?? They import all of it! How ridiculous! Because they also fish there. So its a little crazy it's I would have to go to Galicia and eat octopus and caldo gallego. And go to Ponferrada to eat food typical of the Bierzo. Like botillo. It's a pig bladder stuffed with chorizo and pig tail and sometimes tongue. It sounds terrible but it is actually really really good. I would have to do a huge tour of Spain because there is so much to do there. Also I would go to a barcalona verus Real Madrid game. Those get intense. But, money is an object so all these dreams are pretty extreme. But it would be sooooooo cool! I'm wondering how I can make it possible. Have you ever been to Spain? Most people here think it is a third world country but it's a super nice country. Their economy isn't the greatest right now but it's getting better I think. Or at least I hope that it is getting better... So, have you ever been to Spain? You have to go see it! Well visit it. And stay awhile. Because it's a lot of fun.

So if there's a way to copy the way neurons work, then maybe they can accomplish that?

1478,1478,858c8c85-c83b-4940-9e85-3e4880f9f038," The last film that had a lasting impact on me... That's a great question. I think it was Ready Player One. It's a film about video games and how they can take over the lives of people and jeopardize the safety of many people. It's very consuming on people's life's. Also it talks about not talking to strangers because they aren't who they say they are. What about you? What do you think? What film had a lasting impact on you. Are you there? You haven't been responding... So...what was a film that has had an impact on you? Do you have one or not? Also, do you enjoy watching movies? I don't enjoy it all that much. I feel like it's a waste of time. But I will do it occasionally. When I have a lot of time to kill. But I do love sports. Tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, baseball, football. Literally all sports are wonderful. And they are healthy for your longevity. It helps you live longer. Are you still there? Sorry I just got back. Hello? Hey so I was wondering if you were still around or not.... It's wicked awesome to just chat with yourself I guess. There's not much else to do...or talk about."," Sorry I just saw this I really liked ready player one as well. But I think that the last film that I saw that really affected me was A Star is Born with Lady Gaga and Bradly Cooper I am not sure if you will respond because it took me so long to respond but I guess I can talk to myself like you did before Are you excited for thanksgiving break? I know that I am! I can't wait to see my family. They are coming up from California and they are going to meet me in Provo and then we are going to drive up to Idaho to my aunts house I think we are going to do a lot of fun things like an escape room, lots of good food, hikes, and maybe see a movies There are lots of great movies that are coming out this Thanksgiving I am really excited to see moves such as Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet, Spider-man welcome to the spider verse or the Grinch It seems like all the good movies come out during the holiday season because lots of people go to. the movies in big groups during the holidays I actually really like watching movies and film My dad is a film director so I grew up watching movies as a kid I also really enjoy analyzing box office trends, production budgets and other things relating to film But most recently I have been trying to live a more productive life. I have been making goals and I want to start working really hard to achieve some of them I got this idea from watching the youtube channel YES THEORY They are a group of three guys that do things that get them out of their comfort zone They go to different countries and talk to strangers, explore abandoned places, and doing positive things such as helping other overcome their fears or try things that they have never done beofre before Do you ever watch youtube groups I usually don't but Yes theory really inspires me to do different things and push myself to be a better more enthusiastic person in the future I guess I will keep talking to myself because im getting a bunch of points Are you doing this trying do this to try and win a laptop or an ipad I really think it would be awesome to win an iPad pro I love using the iPad Pro for drawing and sketching I recently started drawing and sketching on computers and iPads I need like 200,000 more points to be entered into the drawing How many points do you have I have around 200,000 points right now so I have to keep talking to get my points up I am trying to beat my sister and she is in like 15th place Have you ever watched the show Friends I recently discovered the show in July on my trip back from the Dominican Republic I was on the plane and there were not very many great choices for movies and one of the options was three episodes of Friends I had tried the show earlier but I didn't  really like the show very much because of the laughing track and the style was kinda outdated But I watched the three episodes on the plane and I really liked the show even thought the episodes were from  the last season of the show so none of the episodes really made sense but I kept watching because I really liked the characters and the tone of the show It was really easy going and fun Since the I started the show in July or early August I have finished the show once and am watching it for the second time I really enjoy following the characters and their lives Do you have a favorite show or movie I really like The Office, Parks and Rec, and now Friends Sometimes I hate Netflix, I watch and watch sometimes when I really should be studying or doing something else productive I am watching it now while im typing since this conversation doesn't take a lot of effort or thought Right now im watching an episode about how a lady calls Chandlers phone asking about a guy named Bob She sounds like a very attractive person and so Chandler sets up a date with her and comes in and pretends to swoop in and comfort her He pretends to be this person and try to hook up with her Also Monica gets promoted and so there is an argument between the people int he friend group that have jobs that pay well versus the people who dont Have you enjoyed your time at BYU Its just my first semester here and it has been a blast It seems like theres is always something going on which is really cool I have almost gotten this conversation up to 100,000 points which is pretty good for just talking to myself I guess its kinda like a journal that robots are going to read Lately I have been missing my family a lot and can't wait to see them over thanksgiving I also really want a car to drive around to different places I really like all the people here but sometimes it feels a little intimidating. there are so many people and I think I need to just push myself out there and meet more popel people This week I have several midterms that I have to study for I am taking a Chemistry and Environmental science test this week I have to go to several reviews this week so that I am ready to get A's on both of them I have all A's in my classes now but a few of them are kinda low and it would be awesome if I could do well on my tests so that I can get those grades up I really need to get good grades this semester so that I can get a full scholarship for next semester My parents said that they couldn't support me through college so I had to work hard to earn scholarship and work to get enough money to pay for tuition and housing and food Over the summer I worked at a construction site called Judson Construction While working on site I primarily cleaned up trash and worked with the plumbers to prep the plumbing for the dry wallers to come in and finish the walls I insulated all the water pipes with foam tubbing and hammered plates into the studs in the wall so that if anyone using a nail gun can't puncture the tubbing and cause a leak I learned a lot on the site I have never worked on a construction site before and I was surprised to learn a lot and actually make pretty good money I made 16 dollars an hour which is above minimum Especially compared to the wages in Utah I think minimum wage in Utah is something like 7.50 which is crazy cause it is almost half of California minimum wages I have been looking for a job up here in Utah but all the jobs here in Utah pay like 8-10 dollars which is really low One day when I was running with my friend up by Rock Canyon and we stopped to help this lady poor mulch  and she offered me and my friend  a job paying 20 dollars an hour which is amazing especially for Utah pay So far I have only worked one hour but Im planning on working more so I can earn money Although I have all my tuition covered I need some extra money to do things on the weekend"," I don't think I've seen that one, but I'll have to check it out. It sounds interesting. "

This happens a lot, people are waiting for a chat and walk away from the computer and then just leave it open, so when I actually connect. No one replies Anyways My roommate just proposed an hour or so ago I was hiding in the bushes with my camera taking pictures of the whole thing I am excited for them, and Im excited to go to their wedding Its out in california over the summer luckily i have another friend who is getting married in california So it makes justifying the trip a little easier So Ill just tell you a story New Transfer, new start. I was a missionary serving in northern California. Driving away I gave one last glance at the quiet town I loved and trekked for 8 months cushioned in the berms of snow by the ned of that day my world had been flipped upside-down. Everything I had gotten used to would be wiped clean. This new town was always on the go. New town New people new rush it was like they never slept, they never were home, they never stopped working So what time would they have for us, the elders at their door? our area was a mere square mile where people lived. The other hlaf was just a large grass field, underdeveloped except for the outlines of dirt roads. These showing potential -- potential homes, families, dreams. But for now it stood empty and exposed to the storms So, my companion and I walked the same streets; over and over again. the possibility of having a car was out of the picture, even bikes would get us places too fast, so walking it was walking matched the pace of the work we had to do maybe that was the one thing that was the same, the speed of the work The days were long and rainy. It was futile to even hope of being dry. no coat, umbrealla nor even careful planning would come close to winning that war the water would always find a way to soak in After losing battle after battle of having any sense of being dry doubt came along In crevices unknown each penetrating slowly leadin the way for more to follow What good does a raincoat do if the rain always wins Each day, I slogged up and down the busy streets. Endless cars roared by the rain poured down, yet piercing through were the shrieks of honks and  cutting of words Every word somehow was so clear in y ear. I envied my companion who never heard them. He would turn to me and ask what they said shrugging i would lie and say I didnt catch it that time I did Each word was so sharp they always found their way above the cacophony of sounds. draining down, pulling waht little confidence i had along with it. as the storm went on my umbrella dropping a little lower my jacket was pulled a little tighter  and my gaze reduced to tracing each sunken step still the rain always found it way in One thousand five hundred houses. each we counted on the map only 4 houses knocked a day for a year Therefore, it would take knocking 8 a day to finish in the 6 months I was there I could have only hoped it have been that easy Repeatedly we would get doors closed one following another. The process became fluid, trailing from door to door anticipating each response Expecting each day to get back soaking wet and I had nothing new to report to the Ward mission leader but the empty outlines of the streets we walked As my days dragged on, it never felt like enough. I never had enough cover to stay dry only wet clothes on the hanger to dry each night. My shirt dripped theere as awhite flag surrendering the last hope I held To this point in my mission I sought to live up to the call to serve I promised to give everything I had and to use my talents to build the kingdom of God. My  talent lied in specifically drawing For 13 months I stewed over how I could even use my talent effectively to do just that Each idea I had would give up too much time, time better spent using my last bit of hope approaching people In teaching I could squeeze a little drawing in here and there to show the plan of salvation. Or to show some gospel concept in a visual way still I never felt like that was enough we just didnt have the time to do art in the way I had always known Trying to start anything in our time at the apartment I could only get so far leaving me with unfinished papges of un purposeful lines these seemed to mock me I never would have the motivation or time to get what I wanted out of them I started to see them as maps of our defeat just the outlines of each empty day Maybe those pages had potential to become something to create hope or inspire dreams for now they were just another banner of surrender how could outlines mean anything more on a blank canvas The next transfer arrived and with it came the news of a new companion upon meeting him something seemed to clear almost a spark maybe it was just the idea, or the hope he brough but excitement swept through my veins again. This Elder loved art he admitted he wasnt very good at it Though upon discussing the area we devided to try something new. The tides seemed to switch finally, and light gave way through the clouds for the first week in months there was no predicted rain We left the next day with a box of chalk in tow. That was our answer creating chalk art that would sahre our message since no one was really letting us sharing it otherwise figuring that we owuld run out of people to talk to soon we needed this new approach. this time i traced the path to homes of families in the local congregation with a twinkling optimism house after house we would spend enough time to leave a simple message. quickly a few in the congregation came and rallied behind us, with families volunteering their driveways and sidewalks to the cause. within the weekwe had art dispersed thorughout our area the words seemed to bring a symbol of accomplishment and with it returned hope then once again the rains returned wiped clean hours gone though washed away in one night the chalk had left a message on more than just the concrete it was enough time for more families to volunteer their plots we began again. Each a new canvas each a new approach We pushed ourselves making the messages more elaborate and detailed. This time friends and neighbors noticed opening new doors and opportunities walking didnt seem so treacherous as the slander began to be mixed with call of cheer from the families excited to see what we would make next Washed clean, the rains came again. Still determined we set out once more pushing further this process repeated each time receiving new strength to our ranks the congregation began to invite their friends to provide their driveways they posted the art to have a larger outreach I continued to make the pieces more intricate Now with confidence I left masterpieces along the streets we also were able to enter homes that once turned us away many were impressed to see something so different and this gave us a chance People would approach us as we were making new pieces and ask us to come by to their home I had purpose restored and miracles to report daily to our ward mission leader Finally the time  came that the rains stopped and with it was the news that we were both moving to a new area my companion and I set out to leave one final mark we found a home that stood facing a busy intersection there we traced a final message John 14:27 Looking back its easy to see that through the storm I was able to find peace I had overcome the turmoil and darkness that encompassed me I found hope and strength through persistence repeated trial and test a seemingly endless cycle just like the rains tore me down i was worn down and alsmost lost when I had nothing left but the outlines of my faith, it drove me to redraw everything I had previously known I finally found Gods purpose and forgot my own even after leaving the congregation and following missionaries would go and trace our last words these were the outlines that came to mean everything each tracing a hope that could no longer be washed away Well thats it thanks for listening or reading or not", hello how are you, That's so exciting! I hope you have a great time at the wedding. I'm sure they'll love it.

With all the recent policy/structural changes in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I think it's important to recognize how change can be a really good thing Although, understandably, change isn't always a good thing.

Sadly, however, much of the change associated with climate change is quite negative. I do wonder if it will force us to adapt more rapidly - to create better technology and new methods of transportation, entertainment, even shopping which will not only improve the environment, but maybe even help reverse some of the negative effects of human interactions on the planet. I'm no scientist, but it does make me wonder.", I don't know I would talk about hypnosis., I agree. I think we need to be more mindful of climate change and the impact it has on the environment.

2555,2555,04e2a0d6-2882-4f05-ab52-921aba5f2c4a, hey," Hello! Nice to see you again. You spoke so quickly, I see your response before the CCC prompt. (I just realized I haven't read the prompt to speak in, um, many turns.) Do most people talk about the prompt? Maybe I'm just strange, but I find it a little . . . boring, to be honest. Most of them, at least. Not that the prompts are bad! I think they're rather clever, being frank. But I suppose I've never liked having a predefined pattern for the conversation to follow. It's nice when you feel like you're ACTUALLY talking to somebody else instead of following a script someone else made, you know? And I think part of the reason that I love to be on here so much is that I DON'T feel required to fit a mold. They just want chatting, right? Well, I can chat. Heh, I can chat a LOT, apparently. And, more than that . . . I'm kinda determined to win. I think someone else is as determined as I am, which makes it difficult, but what do you do? I'm going to be off later today, which, um, is probably going to be problematic. Man. I have things I need to do, I just realized. Nothing too crazy, but I DO have to set up a schedule for math tutoring. It shouldn't be too hard; just time consuming. I'm thinking it shouldn't take me longer than, like, three hours at most. (I'm trying to be pessimistic with my time so that I'm not frequently surprised by how long things - take. I've been consistently wrong about how long things take.) But, the problem is, unless I want to be up until midnight tonight, I can't get started on it at all. Or, hang on, let me phrase that in a way that makes sense. I don't want to do the schedule right now because I'm worried that I'm going to lose my ranking. I've invested a lot of time into here. A LOT. Trust me on that. I think I'm nearing, what . . . fifteen hours? . . . which, okay, isn't that much. But it's still pretty consistent. Actually, if we go on the higher bounds of scoring and say that I earn 100,000 in a single hour, then with my 5.7 million points, that's . . . 57 hours? Uhhhhh, I don't think I've put in THAT much time. That's a lot. That's really a lot. And if we go on the flipside and say that I earned 300,000 in an hour, then at 5.7 million, that's still . . .  18 hours. Ooof. I have less of a life than I'd thought. There are two solutions to this, then. I either up my typing speed, or I spend more time chatting. Or both. Regardless, I'm not throwing 20+ hours down the drain because I wasn't willing to suck it up a few more days. Puh-leaze. I can handle a few more days. I worked a fast food job for a bit, and I would've gotten the same amount of hours in four days of work. I'm not ecstatic about having to babysit my score, no, but it's something I'm certainly willing to do. I . . . want to prove to myself that I can do it. I very very nearly quit early on. He was 1.5 million points ahead of me, and I just . . . oooh, I very nearly quit right then. 1.5 million points is, what, seven hours of talking? Maybe 10? He was so far ahead--and he continued to climb. The funny thing was (I may have told you already, so bear with me), I was planning on doing the same thing to him: get so far ahead that he loses hope of winning at stops - trying. It's a good tactic, apparently. *and Well, I asked myself if I really wanted to win, if it was worth it. I wanted an iPad, sure, but it was more . . . it was more that I'd told myself I was winning that iPad. If I couldn't do this, something that's relatively simple, how on earth am I supposed to keep my bigger commitments? *was I And when I was looking at that 1.5 million spread, something that looked bleak and hopeless, I had to choose. Do I fight my way back up, knowing it may be fruitless and that I'll lose every hour I invested into this? Or do I quit now? Because what's the point of investing time and energy and hope into something that was bound to fail, anyway? That last one was critical to me. I didn't want to hope for something I thought was impossible. Time and energy are something I had in abundance (though, I have arguably less now, for some reason). I didn't care all the much of I lost what I'd put into it already. *all that much if No, it . . . it was more the fact that I could . . . do it. That I, myself, could do it. That there would be a single winner, and that winner would be me. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the prize; that much is true. No point in investing myself into something that's not going to pay. But . . . I also wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a small fire within me that's calling me to do it. It's a very strange sensation. I've never been an ambitious person. It's not that I never did well in school or anything. I did. But . . . I didn't have my sights set very high. No reason to. I was content with being good with where I was, and there wasn't more to that. Well . . . I ran into a classmate a while back. I knew him, of course, but I'd never really gotten the chance to talk to him. I'm not even sure what changed. I knew he had internships to places, but . . . I don't know. One day, he came back talking about how he got this internship at Vanguard, and I asked him about his past and whatnot, where I found out that he'd already had four summer - internships, starting when he was sixteen. He was talking about graduate school and various other places, and then, get this, he started talking about Google. Yes, as in THE Google. One of the top five tech places to work. He landed a few interviews with them, and now he's just waiting the call back to see if he made it. (Technically, he has one interview left to complete, but he finishes this - week.) Somewhere along the way . . . somewhere, I think I gained a small ambition. Me, who's never been ambitious for anything aside from getting into BYU, suddenly had her eyes opened to a new world. A world where you can achieve so much if you set your heart to it. If the sacrifice is worth it, if the struggle is worth it, if the pain is worth it, you can go out and touch your dreams. Oh, whoops! I forgot this was still open. I got sidetracked. Well, ah, if you're not here by now, you probably won't be later. Hope I see you again, Pito! Uh, hey?"," Hey, how are you?

Of course, that's if I pass my history oral exam first that is.. If nobody is on here do I still get the points? I might as well try So here is my idea for the star wars Obi Wan solo movie We open on a scene of Obi wan overlooking a desert planet A large red giant sun rises over the horizon, filling nearly the whole sky. Obi wan looks tired and worn out His clothes are ripped His lightsaber is dangling from his belt Close up on that Star wars fanfare plays and we cut to space Darth vader is looking down at corusant from a starship He knods to a commanding officer, and they blast the capital city from space, destroying the jedi temple Darth Vader then goes to talk with the emperor The emperor is basically like ""Dude, you gotta kill the Jedi who escaped"" Darth vader's all like ""Alright, that's cool, but how do I find them?"" The emperor is all like ""Search your feelings, reach out with your hate"" And darth vader is all like ""Bruh, IDK what that even means so....."" Then he leaves Back to Obi wan, he receives a distress call from a planet that is basically on giant frozen ocean It's all like ""Any jedi still alive or nah?"" And obi wan is like ""What's up fam"" And they're all like ""There are 3 of us here on this planet. Come find us"" Obi wan is all like ""OK, cool. Be there in a few"" DV also hears the call too But he forgot to save where it came from And there's no caller ID so he can't just look it up So he has to send out these probe droids to the general area And then he goes to eat. Because I've always wanted to see Darth Vader eat in his suit Like how does that happen? Is he all like helmet less and cringey? Or does he have to awkwardly shovel bit of like toast in through his mouth slit? I kinda wanna see that part of Return of the Jedi ""I am your father"" *Slides toast in through breathing slit and we can hear him cruching down on it"" It would be kinda hilarious I mean, could you imagine how funny that would be? It would totally kill the whole bad-a vibe But at the same time, make him more huma *human Like he was a teddy bear in a robot body Who killed lots of people and is kinda sadistic with 3 missing limbs and an irrational fear of sand Ok, so he wouldn't be like a teddy bear but he could be like a weird uncle who eats toast through a mask it would be funny also, something I never understood what happened to Jar Jar? I mean like, chronologically, is he dead? the emperor dissolved the senate in episode 4 and if jar jar was on the senate then does that mean he died? I think so. thats good jar jar needed to die he wasn't played by michael jackson, so he wasn't good I mean, michael jackson shows up and is all like ""bro, I wanna play jar jar"" and george lucas is all like ""bruh nah"" who turns down michael jackson?! the man is a freaking icon especially thriller that was tight I can kinda do the dance not well but like well enough people know whats going on they're like ""ooh, thriller that's kinda coo *cool literally rn, i'm just typing random stuff at work because nobody else is on the chat I hope i get points for this this has been kinda sweet i'm getting paid to sit here and do this kinda its slow not many people come to the (redacted) at 5:16 am in fact, not many people are awake at 5:16 am i know I wouldn't be but i'm a broke college student and i like money and food and eating and sleep but sometimes you gotta do whatcha gotta do what is this for again? is it like the alexa challenge thing? because i have an alexa, and i think she's haunted like seriously at random times i'll just hear a beep or i'll have a date over and she'll start playing slow jams i'm all like ""alexa, look, you're a good wingman, but cool it"" i think she has a ghost inhabiting her because ghosts are real i saw a ghost train last night for real i was on my way home from work, and i saw this super old train filled with passengers just looking out the windows but heres the thing the passengers were dressed all old timey and the tracks had been out of service forever and it was midnight on halloween now, i'm no parapsychologist, but that sounds pretty spooky to me it was like an episode of scooby doo what ever happened to that show? it was a solid show i mean, a talking dog and his hippie friends solving mysteries? that's literally the dopest thing ever like the van oooh, its a thinga beautry *beauty its like fine artwork just in the form of a van is it a van? sometimes its a station wagon no, i think its a van ok, but can we talk about the jazz game last night? how terrible was that?! that's just embarrasing to have that happen on our home court and i mean, i think we can pull off this series but we need to play jazz ball we can't play rocket ball the series is back in their favor we have to shut down chris paul, because he usually is the one throwing dimes to james harden if we shut him down, harden can't do squat except flop he can flop like a fish on a dock and what is up with his beard? I mean, has he seen a razor before? I'm in full support of bros growing beards,  but that's just ridiculous i bet he's wearing it to hide something like a mole or melanomia or a really ugly facial tattoo or another set of eyes that would be freaky thats why he can shoot 3s so well he can see the basket twice as well as everyone else or would that just screw with your depth perception either way, i'm getting bored, so i'm going to be done.

3385,3385,320d7df9-1117-4172-af3d-9eaa9aee6237, Hello," Hello Brian! So I was thinking about something we talked about yesterday on here. Meditation. My question is: can meditation be selfish? Because if you think about it, the only person you are focusing on during mediation is yourself. And Jesus taught that when we feel overwhelmed we should look outward and serve others. You can't serve anyone if you are alone in a room meditating. I know it's not inherently selfish. There is nothing wrong with wanting to improve yourself. But what I'm saying is does it have the potential to be selfish? Like those monks that just believe in solitude and they spend all day meditating in a sanctuary. Is that selfish? It seems to go against what Jesus taught when he said to be a light into the world. You said that meditation is about transcendence, or about finding yourself. Your true self. But isn't there a scripture that says he that shall find his life shall loose it, but he that shall loose his life for the gospels sake shall find it? So it seems a little counterproductive in that sense to even be meditating at all. Why not use the time to interact with and serve others? Anyway, that's my rant on the matter. But I'm curious to see what you think about the subject. Are you still there. I'm starting to get worried that you slipped in the shower or something. If you can hear me please respond. We are not getting as many points this way. Well, I'm still getting points haha."," Hi, how are you? I just got back from walking my dog. Do you have any pets?"

Weirdest thing, it has you typing something before the prompt, saying the exact same thing as the prompt. Not sure if that is intentional or just a fluke. I'm curious, are you a moderator? For some reason I keep running into chats where the other person doesn't respond.  I don't know if that is supposed to happen. Maybe there is a glitch in the program right now.  Not exactly sure. And to respond to the prompt.  Yes.  i don't think catfishing needs to be done by a human to actually be catfishing. If anything it's even more likely to be catfishing if it's not a human doing it. Because I believe that catfishing basically means fooling someone into thinking that they're in a relationship with someone they're not actually with. So if a computer were doing that, it would totally be catfishing. I think it's going to be very interesting what kinds of laws and moral ideas will be put into place when AI becomes a lot more normal and commonly used. Also does the United States decide on the policy for AI, does each country decide for themselves, or does  an international panel  decide on the laws? Lots of uncertainty there. I'm going to give you a couple more minutes before just giving up on this conversation. I'm hoping that these chats aren't disregarded for having someone on the other end who won't respond.  Because that would stink.  I've had a couple chats now like this... ... where I just talk to myself for like 30 minutes before just giving up. So, I'm just going to end this chat and sit in the que waiting for the next person to come along.  Only so much I can talk about with myself.", I don't think so.

And by excercising this faith muscle we can start accomplishing things in our life that we never thought possible. We can do things we never dreamed of. Faith is the power by which all things are done. It is the force that causes all things on this earth to act. It is essential for our progression Okay, it's been great chatting with you.

We got tickets with my parents to see the game behind the end zone on the North side of the field But my dad's friend has these passes to go onto the field, so I went down for the first half with him and my dad went down for the second half It was awesome We got to just follow along the field as the ball went up and down We were like in the hawaii defense huddle just listening to their coach getting angry with them it was super cool We ended up getting home at around 12 though Winnie (my dog) was not happy about that she ended up playing till 1 in the morning So we ended up staying up too this morning we totally slept in on accident and missed all of church Our ward meets at 8 am which kind of stinks so we woke up around 10 and just missed it all So we just kind of took the morning slow and got ready for the day We drove up and through the alpine loop, which was snowing lots and then came to my in laws for dinner/ to do laundry Winnie ended up peeing on Michaela's lap because she was so nervous so that was lots of fun But now we are just chilling out and watching some football as my mother in law makes dinner Fun stuff I I've started a new project at work we are now building out some employee management apps for some clients that I'm helping with I have a good prompt to talk about: Do you think that alternative energies are effective and worth the investment? I personally would say yes Although currently it still does cost quite a bit to operate clean energy plants, the benefits long term are so much better first off, the supply never really dies down.  We will almost always have solar and wind and some of these other solutions that have been invented the trade off is though that coal and natural gas and oil are far cheaper for us to use However, they are limited in supply and they are awful for the enviroment If you can use clean energy for long enough then a lot of times you can get your money's worth out of it. Another thing I'd be curious about your take on is the new bill prop 2 here in utah I think it's very interesting I think it was good that some compromises were made though regarding how strict the bill will be Marijuana should be legal to people who need it medically, but the problem I see with it is that people will use really lame and often times faked illnesses to get access to i it I think the bill is good in that they limit who can produce and sell it.  But, I think that it still doesn't do enough to ensure that only those who are very sick can get access to it. I worry that our state will just be filled with people who claim that for ""nerves"" they need to have marijuana or some other lame made up illness That's the only drawback that this bill will have It just makes it too easy for people to get it. Another interesting topic is that of space travel And whether it's even worth it. I personally would say yes. If you look back on the space race and all the technologies that it brought, it has a huge benefit to society In more recent years we have learned how to land rockets and reuse them(looking at spacex) Been able to make them economical and send people as tourists into space and send more satellites out as well In addition to that, the possibilities with establishing colonies on the moon and mars are just incredible They've discovered ice on the moon and on mars so we know that we could get water from there We have also discovered that the resources necessary for making fuel are present on both the moon and mars This makes it possible not just to land on these planets, but also to leave and return from them If we can establish a colony on the moon then we can then do tests and refine technologies at an exponential speed currently the international space station conducts experiments in zero gravity all the time but having an established colony in a sterile enviroment would make it possible to do so much more. In addition to all of these technologies that we can discover and create there we could also mine the moon for it's resources I don't remember specifically which minerals the moon has, but I have read that there are minerals there that are  becoming scarce on earth and would be very valuable for us. We could mine these materials and ship them back to the states When we have these kinds of operations going on, it makes it possible to create jobs and work there This would allow for more people to go to the moon and businesses to go there as well. These possibilities allow for people to then colonize and have families there thus making a whole nation of it's own on the moon They would probably establish their own laws and govern themselves it could also serve as a base for launching more rockets throughout the galaxy With lower gravity it would require minimal effort to send a rocket off from the moons surface We could test out space elevators! and dock ships out of orbit There are so many possibilities I am really excited to see something like this happen So returning to my original point, I think it would totally be worth exploring space I think the possibilites combined with all the technology that comes with space exploration is totally worth it. I think a lot of Elon Musk and spacex when it comes to the future of our planet. People who are innovative and discovering these new technologies and on the forefront of discovery Autonomous cars are something that are especially intruiging to me Currently we have lots of traffic in our big cities.  Typically its because someone taps their brakes really hard and it causes a chain reaction that goes for miles With autonomous vehicles this wouldn't happne! happen they could communicate with each other and flow perfectly on interstates causes traffic to decrease Merge perfectly without causing other cars to brake They could eliminate the need for intersections because cars would be able to talk with each other perfectly and avoid hitting each other as they pass through And on top of all of this efficiency that they will bring, they would also eliminate millions of deaths per year When you think of it, cars are death trap s we get ourselves killed all the time by stupid human errors cause while driving Autonomous cars would avoid accidents and save millions of lives per year currently tesla has made some huge strides in both vehicle safety and autonomous vehicles Their cars are extremely safe to the point where cars can get absolutely totalled and people walk away unharmed And they already have developed cars with autonomous features, they're just fine tuning it and waiting for legislation allowing for it's full adopted use Another curious thought of mine is technology causing more harm or is it helping more to our future? Technology has definitely done amazing things for us, but I feel like our world is getting very polluted with technology From Cyberattacks to just poor use of technoloyg technology people are misusing technology left and right But overall I think with this increase in technology there is also an increase in awarenees awareness We are becoming more aware of the things that we are doing wrong and trying to correct them with even more technology For example with the industrial revolution we discovered so many good things, however in the process we destroyed a lot of our enviroment Currently we are more aware of this and have placed laws and created new technologies to combat all of the harm that we have done. We are probably creating problems now that we are not even aware of, but I'm sure that eventually we will realize what we are doing and again, course correct Something i'd be interested in hearing about from you is whether or not Lord of the Rings, or some other movie is the greatest on earth I think a lot of people hold harry potter, star wars, or other movies ahead of it. but I think overall Lord of the Rings is still king in terms of the best movies/books ever made Not only is it just so classic but also all of the amazing storylines so perfectly woven it just creates a perfect movie I don't know if anyone could ever a better movie than the Lord of the Rings Maybe like 20 years in the future we will appreciate and want either a remake or a spinoff of it but for now it's definitely the best movie I think as a kid I used to watch the two towers like almost every week i had almost the entire movie memorized The one thing that disappointed me though was the hobbit movies It was really good and all, but I would've appreciated them narrowing it down to just 2 movies and removing all of the extra stuff that they added I liked the first movie and appreciated the third movies action sequences, but I didn't really like the white orc plot line Going back to autonmous vehicles like I was talking about earlier. This is why I think they'll be huge in the future! The car industry in recentry years has seen many new changes that have been revolutionizing the way we see trasnportation. The biggest technological advancement, arguably in my opinion would be that of autonomous vehicles. These are vehicles that drive themselves with no human interaction. Tesla has hit news recently with their accouncements that they will have fully autonomous vehicles running within the following yeras year that is, pending government approval and liscensing restrictions. But even with all this exciting technology, what effect is this going to have on America's future? Not only can autonomous vehicles help prevent fatalities, they can prevent billions of dollars in damages each year making america not only safer, but more economical. In 2015 i remember reading that for roughly every 100 million miles driven there are about 1.12 vehicle fatalities. This may not seem like alot, but considering that there are billions of miles driven in the states thats like tens of thousands of fatalities that we didn't need to have happe happen. Those were all a result of human error. They could have all been prevented with autonomous vehicles. Elon musk thinks that they can have autonomous vehicles that will eliminate these deaths completely I get that a lot of people are skeptical as to whether or not these vehicles are actually safe enough to put our trust in. Especially due to the softwareware malfunctions or lack of human control while driving. But, the fact that AV's will follow traffic laws every time without fail, they'll have updatable software to fix and bugs and they'll improve the quality of their thinking over time, it would be dumb to not accept them. They'll prevent accidents on our roads. Fortunately companies are working in coordination with state and federal governments to push through laws to ensure vehicle safety Both with traditional and autonomous vehicles When these vehicles hit the road in our cities they will help prevent not only the loss of life, but also prevent thousands of car crashes each year saving us billions of dollars in damages. These expenses are a huge burden that AV's can help eliminate. AV's can predict traffic patterns and keep up a constant speed to prevent bottlenecks and accidents on our highways. Time lost is money lost in most commuters worlds. Not only will improved traffic mean more time for the conveniences of work and life, but also more flexibility with work for many as well. Besides just reducing traffic, we could also increase speed limits without causing danger to anyone 2 hour commutes can turn into 30 minute rides instead On the flip side, you could argue that technology is not advanced enough to achieve these feats. The other advantage to AV's is that they can collect data on what is happening in their customers cars and use this to predict what it should do in various scenarios So someone who is driving a tesla themselves, if they brake and the car thinks it wouldn't have braked, they company can look at that scenario and the camera footage and see whether they need to tweak their algorithms to account for that given situation. AV's also have the capability to reduce the need for so many parking lots in cities. With AV's one could run a quick errand or go to a quick meeting and have the car drive around the block or even head home for the day to not have to pay for expensive parking or take up parking in the city. Imagine the possibilities for cities and the opportunites for growth if all of the sudden half of the garages we currently have are no longer necessary. Not only could cities save on teh expensive cost of parking garages, but they could use this extra space is busy cities to build another productive thing such as a park or a commercial office building Many cities and businesses make quite a bit of money on parking and rely on its profits to drive other trasnportation projects forward. However, the potential from other busineesses in these areas will bring them more profits and boost the economy in the city so it would probably still be a win for cities It's hard to imagine a real world application where this would even be possible, cars doing the driving for us. Imagine going to the airport for a business trip or maybe to visit relatives in a different state. I would imagine most people would park their car in an economy lot and leave it there for several days until they got back. not only that, but they are forced to wait 30-60 minutes for the transit from the airport, onto a shuttle and finally to their car. With AV's people will be able to drop themselves off right at the drop off lane at the airport, tell their car to go home to save on the cost of parking, and upon arrival back home they could have it come pick them up right at baggage claim. Not only could people save money, but the convenience of the ordeal will be extremely lucrative in an ever evolving society of innovators. Airports generally are forced to build on lots twice as big as the airports themsevles to accomodate for parking Once again we could save the money and build more productive things than parking in those areas AV's will make way for smaller roads which will decrese the need for large road budgets and save room in cities. Many US interstates can have up to as many as 5-7 lanes for transit going in both directions. These enormous interstates are meant to accommodate the heavy transit that many cities see around the country. While some owuld argue that we should have larger roads with more cars and AV's on the road. Because of their advanced driving abilities we will be able to move more traffic faster and reduce the road congestion. Traffic lanes could also be able to be way smaller due to the accuracy or AV's in keeping distance from surrounding vehicels. Many traffic lanes are fairly wide to compensate for human error, but with AV's we can save on the space in cities and tighten the lanes allowing for bike lanes, larger sidewalks to promote walking parks benches and trees too Cities can save on less road maintenance, a key issue currently in the US We could use this money elsewhere with less money coming in from traffic tickets and parking, this could help exponentially in compensating for the lack of revenue being generate to AV's AV's are going to revolutionize the way we see trasportation because they will provide greater convenience with commuting. Many parents often face the dilemma of how they will be able to take their kids to so many activities and also work to pay the bills. With AV's parents will be able to drive their kids to school while sitting at their desks working. Their cars can tak their kids for them with no worries of risk or injury. The possibilites are endless! Many would argue that these innovations will make us more distant and lazy though too After all we are becoming a super lazy country Lots of obesity, smart phones, less pressure to marry and commit to creating families, all of those factor in to being lazy AV's are already legal in a few states so we know that some states are ready for AV's to become a standardized thing. There have been several laws permitting their use in states across the us currently and many efforts are being made to legalize the use across the country Telsa is so confident that I remember them offering an option to prepay for their autonomous features to have the car preprogrammed for it Several other companies are also working on their own models and pushing to have them ready by 2020 to compete with tesla. Automated busses, trucks and cars will revolutionize the transportation industry. However, even with all of these amazing changes that could result from this technology many are still skeptical as to autonomous vehicles safety and also the effects it could have on jobs. One of the main concerns that people have with this is that if they reduce traffic and accidents, what will happne to the thousands of jobs people currently have realted to commercialized trasnportation not only will many law enforcement officiers lose work but also many commercial drivers as well. There are millions of commercial drivers working in the US currently Thats a lot of jobs that potentially could be cut or phased out due to AV's although they are obviously the economical and safe thing to do considering there are so many crashes each year One must keep in mind that there are very real people out there who currently rely on this lack of technology in the market to make a living. If they were to enter the commercial market than millions would lose their jobs. If we could help curb this job loss the government may need to coordinate to come up with solutions and new opportunities for work. In addition, with the lack of money from tickets and fines coming in, the governments resources for repairing our roads would be greatly reduced cuasing many problems to our already crumbling road system. State governments already spend billions each year There is no denying that AV's will have a positive effect, but the only question to be had is does America trust AV's can I trust these cars with my safety? can I trust they will perform exactly as they are meant to or, will it malfunciton and be the reason for my death or the death of my loved one. Just as operator-less elevators once scared many, autonomous vehicles are going to be benificial and we don't need to be scared. Yeah I honestly don't know if much more can be said about autonomous vehicles Another topic that has interested me quite a bit over the years is that of minimum wage Especially with amazon raising theirs to $15 an hours Although minimum wage in general seems like a very lucrative thing, many do not understand the damaging affects this will have on the poor and working class.  I don't say this from like a middle or upper class perspective thinking only of myslef but as a fellow minimum wage (somewhat) earning college student with the same concerns about finances and same frustrations about income. Many places (primarily Seattle) have been pushing to raise the minimum wage to$15 per hour they hope that this will help out the lower class. I get it, and I understand that people really want this raise.  But I don't believe people understand the downside to the wage hike.  If t they raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour then there will be a decline in the number of jobs for temporary/part time workers there will also be a decrease in demand for those same products and services that those companies rovide Which means, ultimately they will eliminate jobs. In addition to that people probably won't be able to afford a lot of goods Although it sounds like a good idea raising the minimum wage will cause empolyers to fire employees to make up the difference from having to pay so much more In many states the minimum wage is around $9 per hour.  So if they were to raise it to 15 then people would have to charge like twice as much for their products to pay employe employees what we are going to start seeing are jobs being eliminated and either replaced by robots or simply one employee will be forced to cover the work of 2-3 It's going to be terrible! The small companies won't be able to compete and will shut down or downsize dramatically. Big companies will be okay, but they will increase their pricing big time. It will just create inflation for these companeis And for our economy. Which is terrible for everyone honestly It's no good getting paid $6 more an hour when your rent goes up by $200 and your milk and other goods increase by $1-5 each! That's just stupid. i'd rather make $9 in an economy with lower prices than have to do that. We just watched a quiet place and it was pretty good. Very intense, but a pretty good story line I was definitely filled with some anxiety and stress during that movie, because of all of the suspense. I am not sure how I feel about John dying Not a cool event in the movie I was kind of hoping that John would be the one to just go crazy and kill all 3 of them and that their family would all live through it But that didn't happen Super smart though everything they did From padding the walls with newspapers to the oxygen for the baby to the light system and what it meant Really smart ideas that they had I hear that they are thinking of doing a second movie But from the perspective of a different family I would totally go see it We are now watching Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban I forgot how much I really like these movies Kind of makes me Want to Go Back and read the books over again I really like this one Because hermione does that thing where she goes back in time so she can go to more classes Also the whole werewolf thing is super cool Ohhhh and the dementors! Super fun I think this is one of the better movies in this series that they did Some of the books are definitely better, but this is probably the best movie I can't even remember the last time I watched this movie Or any of the Harry Potter movies for that matter Lol my mother in laws dog just fell off the couch trying to walk over to me Super funny I'm pretty excited for tomorrow I don't really have much going on, but I've got a fun project to work on Granted it's with a partner who isn't super involved or super creative, but it should still be fun I think I'm just going to do everything on my own and if he wants to Chip in he always can haha I'm thinking of tutoring as well for like $10 an hour for CS 142 Just to see if I'm good at it and if I am I'm good at it then I'll start charging like $15 an hour I have a job that pays well already, but I just think tutoring 142 would be a lot of Fun! Plus it'll help me brush up on some of my c++ skills Something I haven't coded in for a while That would help me a lot honestly I've had some interviews where they've liked me To code in c++ but all I really have done recently is java Maybe I'll look into it actually Could be fun But only after this week is over, I've already got a lot of other work to do I have my big midterm on Thursday or Friday Haven't quite decided when I want to take it Bye the way, In case you were wondering Harry just made aunt pitunya super fat And she floated away Or not his aunt but his uncles mother actually I don't know how Harry is never terrified of everything that goes on in his magical world I would be absolutely petrified honestly JK Rowling is seriously so creative though All of the little creative details in her books are just amazing honestly I'm pretty excited for our 3v3 intramural basketball team Should be lots of fun I haven't played in quite some time though Maybe like 3 months now, probably a little less But I think I've still got it I guess we will find out when we have our first game probably I'm going to go eat some snacks Be back in a bit I was a little disappointed with the football games today Not a lot of good matchups Well, the patriots playing right now is But other than that there aren't a lot of good games on I think I've only really been interested with packers, rams and chiefs this year So any other game just isn't all that interesting to me Hagrid is now a teacher For your information in this movie we are watching We need to schedule a day To watch nba basketball this week What are you Answering the original prompt, I would totally choose Mozart I actually made a playlist on Spotify called ""beats by Mozart"" it's for studying It's got a photo of mozart with beats headphones on as the cover for the playlist I thought it was pretty funny I really want to Validate my Business idea but am not sure where to start Whether to see competitors rates or to see what I could charge BYU students I think I'll create a qualtrics survey and try and get some people to respond to that for me I need to make it short enough to where people will be interested in finishing,  but long enough to get some solid data I think I'm going to give out some kind of prize raffle sort of thing to encourage people to participate in my survey I think there are lots of grants available for validating business ideas on campus If I can validate the business idea based on a salary projection than I can probably convince them to give me like $500 to validate the student labor aspect Of the idea We applied for one of these grants last year But we're denied because it wasn't really descriptive enough But I think I know how to get the grant now It shouldn't be too difficult There is also this cool thing you Can do where you can make a google ad spoof Basically it will show a title on google, but the webpage actually goes no where, but it tracks how many people that see the ad click on it And you can see demand based on that So maybe I'll do that too I have lots of research to get done before doing any of it I also have lots of research to do for my other idea Of making that machine learning bot to determine angry customers from normal ones I don't even know where I would start for that one I think I need to research which products and services would even allow for that kind of work I then need to find a project that already has voice recognition built into it for determining words and potentially also Determining tone of voice If something like that doesn't exist then I may need to Make it myself That could be a project in itself honesty Honestly But I think it could be very cool and be very profitable If it doesn't pay off at the very least it will be really good experience for me I could show it off as a project I've done for my resume It would be really cool So I need to 1) identify the hardware that I could use 2) determine the languages I need to use 3) determine the basic algorithm/ routine that it would use to maximize efficiency and to teach itself how to read voices The only real big issue is finding a cheap method for storing all the data that it will be gathering as I am testing this I may have to store it locally on my computer until I can raise money to pursue this idea on a larger scale There are a lot of problems to solve still I don't know how to do machine learning Or where to really start when creating this software I don't know if I'll need help or even if it'll take a team of people There is a chance I may have to get funding in order to build a team that can focus on this project Obviously I will try to do all of it on my own, but I may end up discovering f that I'm going to need some Help on it It's all super exciting honestly Once this semester cools down a little bit i will probably really Start to pursue this more I'm really excited though! I'm thinking I may actually start my research into How to Build that software I mentioned tonight Maybe just to get an idea as to where to begin And potentially go see some professors tomorrow to see what they would suggest to build it I am super sleepy already I don't know It If I'm sick or what But I've been really tired like all the time recently My only guess is that I've got to be a little sick on some level I don't know why else I would be this tired I'm torn between things I'd like to get done and things that I know need to get don It's really bothersome honestly I really need to start studying more for my big test I need to start thinking of other business ideas though I need to have some more in case these two ones don't pan out Validation honestl is key with these ideas I need to prove out whether they will work or not And be ready to go through with them if they do Seriously though there is never enough time during the semester for these side projects It really stinks honestly Im curious your thought on whether or not censorship is effective I went to India a couple of months ago and while there got to see a couple of movies both on TV and in the theatres They actually censor Alcohol and Smoking there So like in the actual movie when there is a beer or a cigarrette they'll blur out the bottle or smoke It's really interesting And in commercial breaks on tv they will put messages about how the movie contains smoking and how bad it is for you. I think that although it's really weird, it is actually really effective I know that it would never fly here in the US, but maybe one day when smoking really starts to die down then they will consider it. India actually has a lot less people who smoke and drink then the US Oh that trip was actually awesome So obviously it's much cheaper than the US We stayed at some five start hotels for like $30 a night! It was really cool They also had massages and hair cuts for like $3 total it was awesome I got a full shave and head massage for $3! Super awesome I would totally consider going back there on a vacation Honestly I would consider going to anywhere in southeast asia Because it's so cheap to stay and eat there! We are thinking of actually going on a vacation to Hawaii next year! The polynesian cultural center, pinnaple groves, nice beaches It would be so much fun! But it'll probably be pretty expensive to be honest. So i'll have to start saving up a lot haha I have a question for you So I'm a Computer Science major so my opinion is pretty biased but, I'm curious your thoughts on computers in the classroom I think that it's really good to have them! For me at least it helps me be more productive in my classes, but I can understand how it could also be a major distraction. I don't really know how it is in your accounting classes, but I have a lot of teachers who say that no computers helps more than computers But I honestly think that we should be able to have computers in our classes. I wonder what would happen if instead of having hundreds of countris and governments around the world we just had one large country and president who decided everything for us When we watch all these movies about foreign galaxies It's always like each planet contains one civilization and one single country essentially Like in guardians of the galaxy Star Wars, etc. I wonder why we have never really considered it It could just be that our civilization is so much newer than others I think that we will probably have a moon country that's completely independent before we have a single government for all of the earth Hey I'm back! I was thinking a little bit about space exploration like I was talking about earlier I was wondering whether or not it would be better for the government to start increasing funding to NASA to allow them to pursue space exploration instead of leaving it in the hands of the private sector to do that. Currently it seems like they have a bunch of contracts with private companies so that they don't have to build rockets themselves. I honestly don't even know how they would catch up at this point. Lots of these private companies have been developing these technologies for a really long time now I'm not even sure how much money it would take for NASA to catch up should they have decided to pursue it. The other concern I have with Space exploration is that the company leading the charge in innovation and rocket technology appears to be SpaceX, but as it's run by someone who is not an American, i'm curious if should money come into play if they would build rockets for other countries such as Russia and China Obviously it would be unlikely given that their facilities are all in the United States, but it is a real possibility Not that other countries shouldn't be allowed to explore space too, but I feel that it would be better if the United States was at the forefront of space exploration. That or a joint partnership between countries If we were to establish a colony on the moon then we might have some other issues. Who controls the interests there? Would it also be some kind of international council Would a specific country seize complete control? Would it be completely neutral and only the priv",
te parties involved would have a say? Or would the American Government essential force the private sector to allow it to establish itself on the moon And later on when people start to have families on the moon would they decide to go independent and create their own country or government? Lots to consider. I once watched this cool video about settling the moon and the financial opportunities involved It was very intriguing. I think that if I had the opportunity then I would probably want to take my family and live on the moon It would be awesome! But I don't know if that would be in our best interest. It honestly depends. I really hope that our planet doesn't turn into some Elisium movie type scenario Where the world is just a giant desert and going to the dumps. I could see it becoming a really crowded, run down place Especially with all the damage we are constantly doing to it. But I do believe that mankind is good enough to take care of it and resolve problems that we cause. So tomorrow should be pretty exciting! It's my second anniversary! So we are going to go out to dinner Unfortunately since it's in the middle of the semester we can't really do much travel wise so we are going to go on a trip next summer instead. We are thinking of going to Hawaii! I'm very excited I think that if I can save about $200-300 per month during Fall and Winter semester than we should have enough money saved up by the summer to go! I'm not exactly sure how much it will cost, but I'm guessing it's going to be like $2000 total flying for us and another $1500 for hotels and maybe an extra $500 for food and stuff So probably like 4 - 5 k for the whole trip But that would also be going big Like nice hotels and stuff I think that I might be able to find an all inclusive deal that would be a lot less Okay," I'm going to bed now It's very late goodnight talk to you tomorrow!"""," I've been having a lot of problems with my health lately, and I'm not sure if I'm going to make it to the end of the year.",

I'd probably buy like a flying van or SUV that way I could just live out of it and not worry about hotels and such. That would be quite an adventurous and rewarding life!, I'm doing alright! A flying car would be nice... but how would air traffic be if all of us had flying cars? It would be pretty messy I think... we can barely handle driving within some painted lines. I'd like to see a flying semi truck, That's a great idea! I think I'll do that. I think it would be a lot of fun.
